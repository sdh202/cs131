While not being overly heavy, the novel is neither a quick and easy read.  Susanna Clarke is a wonderful novelist and the story is fascinating, complex and amazingly detailed.  (Much of the detail comes in the form of footnotes, where Clarke describes many little stories of magic, fairies and other such fantastic tales).  Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is the story of those two men, the last two, the only two magicians in England in the early nineteenth century.  The novel follows their story and the story of magic in England at that time.  At times, I warn you, the novel moves rather slowly.  The ending, however, is quite compelling, well-constructed and ultimately satisfying.  Clarke has created a fantastic world, a parallel universe in which the practice of magic is as much a vocation as the law or the church.  The story is wonderful, but, what is special for me was the fabulous characters.  So many of them are so richly drawn and they grow and develop over time.  Characters like these are a rarity and make this novel such an undeniable pleasure to read.  Clarke tells the story with much, much subtle humor, along the lines of Jane Austen and Patrick O'Brian.  As I said before, this is a long book, but well worth every page.  Enjoy.	2005-08-16

This is an excellent, well-written novel--fascinating on so many levels.  Lily, the narrator of the novel is in her eighties, looking back on her life.  She shares the stories of her foot binding, nu shu, the secret women's writing, and the various formally women's friendships that society enforced.  Lily's sister participated in a sworn sisterhood, where a group of young women formed a friendship that was to last until marriage, but Lily is paired with one girl, Snow Flower, her laotong or \\"old same.\\"  Lily and Snow Flower have a love that is stronger than all of her other relationships--and it causes them both more heartbreak.  The novel is really the story of their friendship, its depths, its deceits, its strengths--and it is a fascinating read about a society so different from our own.  Snow Flower and the Secret Fan reminds me in many ways of The Red Tent in that it explores female friendship in a setting much different than any contemporary one.  A fascinating read.	2005-08-14

For any booklover, that aspect alone is worth the price of admission for this one.  Hornby then continues with a wonderful essay discussing what he's read, veering off on tangents that are somehow more than tangential.  These columns are very much like a letter from a clever bookloving friend whose opinion you value very much, while you may not always agree with that opinion.  These essays were all a delight to read.  I only wish there were more of them--but there is always the magazine.	2005-07-16

The narrator, Tom Ripple, begins writing down his thoughts on his life in the early 1970s, essentially so he can look a little more busy at his dull job.  He seems to be about thirty at this point and is frankly not a very likeable protagonist.  He is married with two children and eventually his wife leaves him.  At the start of the novel, his main pasttime seems to be watching television.  He keeps writing, however, and as his life progresses, he grows into a likeable, thoughtful man, a good friend, a loving father.  There really isn't much of a plot in the novel, no one thing other than Ripple's character development as he searches for meaning in his life, in any life.  But with the way Chadwick writes, for some reason, I found I didn't miss the plot.  Ripple is a remarkable character and I found myself truly enjoying this novel.  It is a rich, highly satisfying work, one that I believe will stay with me for quite some time.  Enjoy.	2005-07-10

The nameless narrator tells the story of Edith Lavery, a beautiful young woman who marries up, up into the world of the British aristocratic royalty.  And of course, they are all snobs, for the most part, and the narrator fills us in on every delicious detail.  The novel is full of many witty, wry one liners and has a halfway decent plot to boot. The story line isn't anything new, but that's not the point.  Snobs is a lot of fun to read and chuckle at and frankly, made me happy I don't have to contend with the snobs of England.  Very smartly written, very well done.  Enjoy.	2005-04-26

He imagines his own demise and tells us about it, as he imagines that the village itself is haunted by the ghosts of those who have gone before him.  He, like many others he tells us about, has slowly lost his mind, the solitude has gotten to him.  Llamazares' novel is eerily entertaining, moody, evocative, with a touch of the gothic.

War books are not generally something I read, but this one came highly recommended.  After about 5 pages, I realized I would not be putting this one down.  Evan Wright has put together an excellent recounting of the first few months of the most recent Iraq war based on his 'embed' experience with a group of Marines.  Wright is a magazine writer, so his style here is clear, concise and readable.  I think this book is especially valuable for those (and that would be most of us) who have never been in the armed forces because it sheds light on why members of the military do what they do, helps it all make sense.  The men whose story he tells are all complex individuals and all very human, very American.  Enjoy.	2005-04-24

The book does not focus heavily on his personal relationships with Deborah Franklin, his children and grandchildren (except perhaps with William), nor on his inventions, ideas and creations, but instead focuses on two things:  the perception of  Franklin's public persona and Franklin's metamorphasis from loyal subject of the crown to American patriot.  Franklin is an interesting and complex historical figure and was not as fully appreciated in America during his life as he should have been and Wood explains the political forces that led to that.  Part of the problem, perhaps, was the fact that he had to be \\"Americanized\\" and made a radical.  Those who were already Americanized and radicalized, such as John Adams, had difficulty believing that he fully supported the cause.  The passage of time has of course corrected that misunderstanding.  Wood does an excellent job of telling Franklin's story.  The book is a very readable and engaging account of one of America's most compelling characters.	2005-04-23

Filled with picture after picture of beautiful homes, terrifically decorated.  Let's face it, few people's homes will ever match what is in those magazines.  If those magazines are making you overly envious, or if you just want a good laugh, turn to Interior Desecrations--most likely, you'll feel great about your own home and you'll have many great laughts.  Lileks combines hysterically hideous photos of various 70s decorating schemes (I am unsure where he got these photos, perhaps magazines from the 70s) with his equally hysterical critique of the 70s stylings.  It is really quite humorous and always entertaining.  The perfect coffee table book for those with a good sense of humor.	2005-04-23

The Wedding Night answered that need.  It is an enjoyable Regency romance.  Predictable, but also compelling reading.  Young Cassandra marries the much older Samuel when she is just fifteen.  Nothing happens on their wedding night, young Cassandra is too frightened and confused.  Samuel leaves the country, returning four years later to a woman he hardly knows, but very much desires.  Intrigue, romance, suspicion and betrayal follow.  A perfect, fun, quick read.	2005-04-21

I began this book with a bit of scepticism.  Would it hold my interest?  Would it have relevance to my life?  Yes to both questions.  Kabat-Zinn is an excellent writer--his prose is beautiful.  The substance of what he is advocating is even more beautiful.  His message of mindfulness may start you on a journey, or take you further down your chosen path.  This book is not for everyone, but, if you are interested at all in meditation or mindfulness, I think you ought to read this book.  It will not disappoint.	2005-04-20

There are so many thrillers that I love from the start, but at about the halfway point start worry me.  Will the ending live up to the promise of the great beginning?  So many never do.  So many have endings that are obvious, contrived or just silly.  Well, Hidden River has a great ending to go with its terrific beginning.  The characters are excellent.  Young Irishman Alex Lawson is a former star detective, current junkie who left the force under murky circumstances.  He is somehow involved in a big investigation and needs to escape for a while.  What gets him out of Ireland is the mysterious murder of an old girlfriend many time zones away in Colorado.  Alex is a terrific and charming hero, human, not too macho, funny and endearing.  I really enjoyed this well-written thriller, which, as thrillers go, is one of the best I have read in a while.  Enjoy this one.	2005-04-19

The novel concerns what would happen if, in the 1940 presidential election, FDR had lost to an isolationist, fascist Charles Lindbergh.  Roth tells the story from the viewpoint of a contemporary adult looking back on his boyhood during 1940-1942 in Newark, NJ.  The protagonist, Philip Roth, is a young boy (around 9 I think) when the 'plot' unfolds.  He lives in a Jewish neighborhood of Newark and his parents are horrified when Lindbergh is elected.  His father is constantly touting the horrors that will follow, but no one really listens.  The horrors, however, do follow.  How close could America have come to fascism in the days before WWII?  Roth has essentially re-written history for a brief period of US history and we see it close up, in its effects on young Philip's family, and from a distance, in its effects on the nation as a whole.  This is an intriguing premise and Roth pulls it off well.  This is an engaging read. Well done.	2005-03-03

It has a dream-like quality, a sort of surreal sensibility that will transport you to another dimension.  The story of a young runaway, Kafka, who is in search of his missing mother and sister, is entrancing.  This novel is not for everyone.  It's weird--but I found it wonderful in its weirdness.  It is one, big existential dream.  Enjoy.	2005-03-03

I find so many of those novels to be pretty inane because the heroine gets on my nerves from page one.  Lisa Roberty, the forty-something protagonist of the novel, is unique.  She's jaded from an abusive relationship with a Hollywood star, but somehow strikes up an email friendship with Grant Repka, also forty-something, where the two of them compete to see who had the most 'psycho' ex-lover.  The novel is told from both of their perspectives and consists of many of their email correspondence.  Grant has a girlfriend, and a stunning one at that, so Lisa's little crush on him seems doomed from the start and she knows it.  This novel works so well because of the likeability and believability of both Lisa and Grant.  They test the waters of internet friendship while at the same time flexing their creative writing muscles.  Grant's girlfriend (who is annoyingly perfect) spends much of the novel deriding Lisa's emails and Lisa herself.  The ending of the novel is, refreshingly, not obvious on page 10--and it ends nicely.  Enjoy.	2005-03-01

Ellis' biography of George Washington, His Excellency, is, well, excellent.  I must admit that I don't normally enjoy biography, but after reading Washington's Crossing earlier this year, I felt compelled to pick up this one.  The book examines Washington's life, sometimes in minute detail, and gives us a portrait of a man who was neither a complete saint nor a complete sinner.  This is Washington, the human, although, the fact that he survived the Revolutionary War seems almost superhuman, something Ellis has some fun with.  The book portrays Washington as a man who grew and matured as time went on.  In the years before the Revolutionary War, he wasn't the most likeable person, but something happened to him along the way that made him certainly worthy of the greatness ascribed to him.  He was not without his faults--two issues he should have addressed during his presidency, slavery and Native Americans are dealt with head on in this book.  In the end, though, the book concludes that he is a man who did much more to benefit the nation than to harm it.  His Excellency is a terrific biography, one which brings life to the man on your dollar bill.	2005-02-05

The marriage is not a cordial one, but there is clearly something that draws them together, something that forces them to endure their endless bickering.  Michael and Pauline were caught up in a moment and perhaps should not have gotten married.  Nevertheless, they have three children, and, through unexpected circumstances wind up raising the three-year old son of one of their children.  This novel is really the story of a family that is the product of that marriage; its ups, its downs.  Amateur Marriage is an enjoyable read, one that covers the highlights of the family, and does not tell us what happens every year, thankfully.  I have to say that this is one of Tyler's novels that I have enjoyed the most.  A pleasant read.  Enjoy.	2005-02-04

Reading 102 Minutes is a moving, emotional experience.  There were many times when I had to put the book down briefly, to think about what I had just read.  The book tells the story of the people in the buildings, some who made it out, others who unfortunately did not.  It is the detailed account:  some of the details saved lives, others ended them.  Ultimately, 102 Minutes is a heartbreaking read, full of more \\"if onlys\\" than \\"thank goodness.\\"  I found myself hoping against hope that many of the people I read about would make it out of the building when their location told me they would not, which made the story that much more heartbreaking.  102 Minutes is a powerful book.  I urge you to read it, if your heart can stand being broken, again.	2005-02-04

He gets there to find another man living there, claiming to be him.  Harris then embarks on a Kafkaesque quest to regain his identity, where he ponders the nature of identity itself, with the help of a lonely neurologist and an enthusiastic cab driver.

Kunzru pokes fun at contemporary British and American culture, taking many stereotypes and running with them.  Arjun, a young Indian man, comes to California with dreams of making it big in the computer industry, but reality doesn't make it near his dreams.  He ultimately lands a job and things work out for him for a while, but eventually his situation leads him to make a desperate act that changes everything.  Arjun's story is funny and entertaining, but also a bit sad.  Kunzru thankfully never takes anything too seriously and has apparently quite a bit of fun poking fun at contemporary society.  The novel sails along, flashing occasional comic brilliance every couple of pages.  Transmission is an entertaing novel, fun to ready, funny to contemplate.  Enjoy.	2005-01-31

The novel concerns the relationship between Zeke, a 29 year old painter and handyman who suffers from mild Asperger's Syndrome (similar to autism) and Verona, a single, pregnant woman in her mid-30s in contemporary London.  Zeke's Asperger's makes it difficult for him to understand human relationships.  He once asks a therapist why he has to always respond to people who greet him.  \\"What if I don't feel like it?\\"  He is painting a house at the beginning of the novel when he encounters Verona.  The two share a connection that defies reason.  She leaves the next day, but the two spend the next several weeks struggling to find one another.  Zeke's difficulties with human relationships in general and his relationship with Verona in particular accentuate the notion that no one can understand human relationships.  Some may be able to perform better on the surface than others, but in the end, don't we all behave badly?  Banishing Verona is a marvelous, compelling read.  Very enjoyable and highly recommended.	2005-01-27

Most, if I am lucky, give me a handful of recipes that my family and I can enjoy, but there always seems to be large portions of many that I just ignore as not relevant, not delicious enough, or just not interesting.  Well, The Passionate Vegetarian is like no other cookbook I own.  It is phenomenal; the recipes are delicious and appeal to my entire family.  There is a ginger-carrot-curry dip that I bring to many parties and it is always a huge hit (even with several carrot haters I know).  After cooking several tremendous recipes in this cookbook I realized that there are just no stinkers in here, everything is tasty and you can trust in Crescent Dragonwagon.  One wonderful bonus to this cookbook is Dragonwagon herself.  Each recipe is preceded by a little story of how it came about, and after reading a few of these stories, you will discovery what a warm and wonderful person Dragonwagon is.  Unlike many vegetarian cookbooks, The Passionate Vegetarian recipes will appeal to the meateaters in your crowd.  I highly recommend this cookbook.  It is a delight to read and the recipes are imaginative, yummy and fun to make.  Never anything too complicated and always logical.  This is a terrific cookbook.	2005-01-14

Fischer essentially posits that the crossing was important, because it was the turning point in the Revolutionary War, the moment when the Americans realized that victory could be had.  Fischer's portrait of Washington is compelling.  The man was inspiring, a true moral leader, someone who recognized the worldwide importance of what he and his fellow warriors were setting out to accomplish.  I confess, I do not read much history particularly military history.  I imagine I would read more if the books were more like this one.  I recommend this book for anyone, even those who generally shy away from history books.  Washington's Crossing is a compelling, fascinating and entertaining read.  Well done.	2005-01-14

Ed, the narrator-protagonist, is about to enter his senior year in high school and his main goal in life is to go to Julliard, but his business-oriented dad decides that Julliard won't get him anywhere in life, so he won't pay for it.  Ed and his amusing friends set off on a quest to come up with the cash to pay for college.  It's 1984, so college isn't quite the expensive proposition we now know it to be, but Ed still has got to come up with quite a chunk of change.  The novel isn't really about with getting money for college, it is really about getting the courage to see who you truly are.  Ed realizes his own sexuality, as do most of his friends.  They also become comfortable in their roles in high school (as \\"Play People\\") and by the end of the novel are pretty well-adjusted 18-year olds.  This is a charming novel for many reasons.  Ed is a lovable narrator and his sarcastic, cynical and hilarious look at the New Jersey suburbs in the early 80s is priceless and hilarious.  This novel will make you laugh out loud and will always keep you smiling.  Enjoy.	2004-12-14

The Enemy is an excellent thriller/mystery and I can see why Child's Jack Reacher series has so many followers (but don't understand why there aren't more).  This is an excellent, well-written novel, with enough plot twists to keep you interested, some out of left field, some you may figure out on your own, but none that will disappoint.  The novel opens on New Years' Eve 1989.  Jack Reacher is an MP who has just been reassigned to an army base in North Carolina, and investigates the death of a general in a motel nearby.  It looks like a heart attack, but things aren't adding up.  Other, seemingly unrelated deaths and Reacher's got to figure it all out.  The ending is both satisfying and plausible.  Very well done.

Jacobs and his latest The Know-It-All have proven me wrong.  This book is one of the funniest books I have ever read, as well as one of the most entertaining.  I am skeptical of most nonfiction books, always worried I will be bored and this book was no exception.  Jacobs, however, had me at about page 2.  He decides to spend 2003 reading the Encyclopedia Britannica, all however many volumes there are, every entry, every word.  As he is reading, his life is also happening.  He and his wife are trying to get pregnant, he's annoyed by his in-laws, just a bit intimidated by his dad, and tries out for both Jeopardy and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. Jacobs shares the whole year with us and most of it is very funny.  Each letter of the alphabet gets its own chapter and each chapter is broken down into little essays, some as short as a sentence about some of the entries in the encyclopedia.  Jacobs cleverly folds current events in both the world and his life into these entries.  He shares many interesting, if not always useful, facts.  He also shares the frustration many around him feel with his quest and he is not afraid to reveal himself as a bit of a nudge at times.  Jacobs brings a pop culture sensibility to the Britannica and the reader reaps the benefits of this funny, funny book.  Enjoy. <br />  <br />	2004-12-13

Rachel, the protagonist, is dealing with relationship failures and successes, her mother's bouts with breast cancer, abortion, birth control, friendship, weight gain and many other issues women confront.  The novel will make you think about all of these issues, but it will also make you laugh and make you smile.  Rachel is not a perfect protagonist.  She'll annoy you sometimes with the choices she makes, but in the end that is what makes this book so compellingly readable:  Rachel's humanity.  Enjoy.	2004-11-28

How funny is it?  Anyway, this is an amusing read, kind of a one hit wonder type of thing, but entertaining.  (How many chapters devoted to cads can you have?  Who knew there were so many different types of guys who are, um, just not that into many women?).  Who should read this?  Well, just about anyone.  Clearly the book is aimed at dating women who want to have serious, meaningful relationships and sure, it can help some get out of dead-end relationships, if they heed advice offered in books.  However, any woman who has friends that fall into that category should probably peruse this one.  If a guy is not calling your good friend, and she comes to you for advice, don't tell her she's so fabulous and wonderful that he's probably too intimidated to call her, tell her he's probably not that into her and that she should move on, don't waste the pretty and find a man who is really into her.  Also, for women in serious long-term relationships--reading this one will give you some light-bulb moments vis-a-vis those old, failed relationships.  And should guys read this?  Why not?  Tips on how not to be a jerk and what it does to women when you are.  Date responsibly, and all that.  Enjoy this one!	2004-11-25

There has got to be something about a collection that keeps me reading on after finishing one story.  Natasha is one of those collections that has several \\"things\\" that keep me reading.  First, the writing is excellent.  Bezmozgis has one description right in the first story of spring ariving.  The description is brief but at the same time incredibly evocative.  With that, he had me hooked.  The stories are interesting, particularly in light of the fact that they concern one family and have the same narrator--a young boy who emigrated with his family from Latvia to Canada in the late 70s.  Their early struggles and later successes are captured quite beautifully in these stories.  Natasha is not a imposing collection; it is a brief, enjoyable read--about 145 pages of well-written, compelling stories.	2004-11-23

It is a well-told story that begins with a body of beautiful young woman washing up on the shore of Long Island in the town of Amagansett several years after World War II.  The story intertwines the lives of the fishermen who find the body, the detective investigating the death and the woman herself.  Was she murdered, or was this just an unfortunate drowning?  There are many surprises in this novel that the reader will discover in various parts of the novel.  This is a fun, engrossing read--one you could read in one sitting if you have a couple hours to kill.  People magazine was not wrong in recommending this one.  Enjoy.	2004-11-15

Alan Blair, the novel's narrator, is a 30-year old in-denial alcoholic goofball mooching off his aunt and uncle in Montclair, New Jersey and he may or may not have a valet named Jeeves (I'll let you decide that one for yourself).  Alan has worn out his welcome with his family, and just as they are about to kick him out, embarks on a little journey to New York state--Sharon Springs, followed by Saratoga Springs.  Alan is an intelligent Princeton grad and a writer of one published novel, but clueless about many of life's essentials.  It is his cluelessness, combined with his wry observations of life that make this novel so funny.  Ames' dry humor is unique--I can't think of another novelist to compare him with (perhaps because so few are talented enough to make a reader laugh out loud, to still remember witticisms days after reading them), so if you are looking for a humorous novel, Wake Up, Sir is an excellent choice.  The one thing I found lacking in the novel was the lack of any real plot--the novel is more like an extended road trip.  That shortcoming is pretty minor, especially because this is such an intelligently written comic novel.  Enjoy.	2004-09-21

Dexter Morgan is a self-admitted serial killer (but, if it is possible, he's a \\"good\\" serial killer, as he explains right up front).  By day, he is a blood spatter expert in Florida--which brings him in contact with a horrible serial killer loose in Miami.  His adoptive sister is a police officer involved in the case, who sees this case as her ticket out of vice and into the more prestigous world of homicide detective.  So we have police politics and serial killer gore.  Dexter is a disarming protagonist,  you will find yourself actually liking him because he is so funny.  His social observations are brilliantly on target, viciously wicked.  The novel is a wonderful, refreshing take on the police procedural formula.  If you like your humor a little on the dark side, this novel will entertain and amuse you.	2004-09-13

Hagen's story bubbles with humor and is highly entertaining.  The Laments, well, they travel.  They are African-born British subjects, and we meet them first in Africa, where they live in several countries in search of the perfect job for dad.  The oldest son is born, kidnapped, dies and is replaced with an adopted child all in the first 20 pages.  That is the first of many tragedies that befall the Laments, but the novel is certain not \\"tragic\\" because of Hagen's wonderful sense of humor.  The novel gets compared to Garp frequently and in that sense, it is very much like Garp.  Hagen doesn't take the Laments too seriously and we are not forced to either.  We follow the Laments from Africa, to England and finally to New Jersey, where the novel ends during the 1970s.  Their adventures are humorous and entertaining.  The Laments is a very enjoyable, almost breezy novel that should appeal to most readers.	2004-09-10

Both novels focus on the circularity of time, but Walbert's novel also focuses on the ravages of time, particularly on this collection of women in the novel.  These women were married in fifties and now are all alone, deserted by husband and children by death, by divorce, by choice.  Time is running out for them, but not many of them acknowledge that.  Time swirls by them, the past comes back, they relive it, it repeats itself.  These are wealthy women, not usually pitied, yet their stories echo with horrible tragedy, much death, many sadnesses.  The narrative in the novel is lyrical without being too much or two twee.  Walbert has done an excellent job; Our Kind is an excellent, moving novel.	2004-09-07

The initial narrator tells a brief story of meeting one of the refugees held there, Alan Sheriff, who is seeking political asylum and whose story makes up much of this enjoyable novel.  Alan was a very successful novelist, with an American publishing contract, in a fictional country that is a thinly-disguised contemporary Iraq.  His life is ideal, or as much as that can be when living under a despot's rule, when it pretty much crumbles in front of his eyes.  His beloved wife dies suddenly and he is subsequently 'asked' by the Great Uncle, the tyrant of his country (and a dead ringer for Saddam Hussein) to ghostwrite a novel for him.  The request is not just for any novel, but one which is so wonderful and moving, one which so exposes the effects that economic sanctions are having on his country that the world's superpowers will be convinced to removed those sanctions.  Part of what makes Keneally's novel so wonderful is that it is both a politcal novel and a novel about writing and the creative process.  Keneally masterfully, seamlessly blends these two genres into an enjoyable whole.  The novel is at once a politcal allegory and a story of symbolic writer's block.  It is an excellent, heart-breaking story, well-done and compelling.  Enjoy.	2004-09-06

It tells the story of two men and their friends who devoted years of their lives to discover the truth about a sunken U-Boat off the coast of New Jersey.  The story is compelling, interesting and well-written and, unlike many works like this, does not contain an outrageous number of filler and asides to make the story a book and not just an over long magazine piece.  It's a quick read--a perfect beach read given the setting.  The story it tells is fascinating.	2004-09-02

I find most novels either too cheesy, too boring, or both.  1876, however, is neither.  Rather, it is a terrific, timeless, timely novel.  The novel is narrated by Charlie Schuyler (who apparently narrated Vidal's earlier novel Burr, one which I have not yet read), as he returns to the United States, after spending many years in Europe, in late 1875 with his 30-something, widowed daughter Emma.  Charlie is in his sixties and is returning to the United States to write, earn some money, settle his daughter and hopefully, earn a diplomatic post in France.  He attaches himself to Samuel Tilden, the New York governor who will surely, Charlie thinks, win the next election.  As we all know, there is winning elections and then there is getting inaugurated, but more on that later.  The first portion of the novel takes place in New York City and reads very much like an Edith Wharton novel:  it is all balls and social events, etc., but told with Charlie's relentless cynicism and wonderful sense of humor.  Charlie then travels to Washington D.C. and again regales the reader with more of that cynicism.  That later portions of the novel are largely political, with the recounting of the shocking, to read them now, events surrounding the presidential election of 1876.  If Vidal had published this novel say last year, I would say that much of what he has Charlie say is motivated by the politics of the present day.  Perhaps it was motivated by the politics of the mid-1970s.  The fact that the commentary relating to the 1870s written in the 1970s is still relevant in 2004 is a testament to just what a fine novel 1876 is.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, despite my historical fiction misgivings.  If only all authors of historical fiction were as talented as Vidal.  Enjoy.	2004-09-02

Hosseini's prose is beautiful and his story, heartbreaking.  Amir and Hassan are two young men living in Afghanistan in the mid-seventies.  Amir is well-off, while Hassan and his father work for Amir's family.  They are best friends, as much as they can be given the relationship about which Amir, the narrator, at times feels very uncomfortable.  Amir recounts a series of incidents in their youth where Hassan stands up for Amir, but Amir fails to return the favor when he can.  Their lives take separate paths soon after, but Amir is haunted by what he considers a major mistake he made in his life.  The novel takes us up to the present day, and all the horrors that Afghanistan has gone though since the 70s.  The Kite Runner provides a human side to those distressing stories in the news.  Amir's tale is an engaging, engrossing story, the plot has many twists (some more believable than others), but it is the writing that in the end is the strongest element in this novel.	2004-08-31

What it is is a fun, light and entertaing novel with characters you will enjoy hearing from and care about.  I have read a couple other \\"assistant-lit\\" novels and they have been horrible--more about the axe the author has to grind than an anjoyable read for the reader.  This one is a huge cut above.  Robin Lynn Williams goal is to entertain and her novel fulfills that goal.  The Assistants concerns five young attractive Hollywood assistants whose bosses lives are intertwined, and thus theirs are too.  Each chapter is narrated by a different assistant and Williams does a good job distinguishing their voices and personalities.  The story line moves forward quickly--The Assistants is a compelling and fun read.  I really enjoyed it and I actually cared about what happened to the five assistants.  And, as a bonus, it's actually funny and will make you laugh. <br />	2004-08-30

I thought it was cleverly written with wonderful characters and very, very witty.  The premise is this:  a loosely-connected group of acquaintences forms a book club to discuss Jane Austen's works.  Each chapter of the novel focuses both on the Austen book at hand, and the life of the book club member hosting the meeting that month.  With six members of the club--well, you are not going to be able to get into the nitty gritty of each member's life without a long, drawn-out magnum opus.  Fowler instead chooses to focus on a few events in the various character's lives.  They all know each other, so the various members pop up in the other chapters as well.  The novel is narrated by all of the book club members, speaking as one voice, which Fowler uses to her advantage on many humorous occasions.  Each character is wonderful, yet flawed.  The novel is a comedy of manners in the modern sense.  You will recognize parts of yourself and others you know in many of the characters.  There is no true \\"plot\\" to this story, although the love lives of many of the members, while unresolved at the beginning of the novel, resolve themselves towards the end.  The lack of plot doesn't matter, however, in this truly cleverly written, enjoyable, engaging novel.  I think this one is a must for anyone who loves to read--you don't have to be an Austen fan to enjoy it.  I for one think this novel deserves the hype, and believe me, I was pretty sceptical at first.  Enjoy this one:  it is a treasure.	2004-08-28

I will admit, it took me a while to get into the novel.  It is a little slow at first and there is little to no actual dialogue, but mainly summaries of dialogue in long, paragraph form.  The characters, however, were what ultimately won me over.  They are all pretty amusing and you will see shades of yourself, and everyone you know, in many of them, which makes them somehow even funnier.  The novel takes place in 1979-1981 Chicago and concerns several families living there whose lives overlap.  Much happens in the novel, although there is no real plot moving the novel forward constantly, just a series of subplots, none more important than the other.  I won't summarize the subplots here, others have done that more than adequately, but I will say this:  Crossing California is a big funny novel about humanity, filled with warm and flawed characters you will grow to like, in spite of those flaws.  If you are looking for a novel with one big story line and lots of dialogue, well, you won't like this one.  If that's not important to you and if you enjoy novels with excellent, keenly observed characters, pick up Crossing California.  It is a great read.	2004-08-16

There is so much going on in this novel that a quick summary of the plot would be pointless (and darn near impossible).  Amazon has summed it up nicely on these pages.  Suffice it to say that Quicksilver is a great, big read, one which will take you a while to get through.  But you'll enjoy every minute, every word.  Stephenson is a master.

You think this book is probably pretty boring.  Tax Collector?  Well, I assure you, it is certainly not boring; rather, it is an oddly compelling read that I just couldn't put down.  (And no one is more shocked about that than I am!)  Richard Yancey worked for 12 years as a revenue officer for the IRS collecting (or at least attempting to collect) unpaid employment taxes from small businesses.  It was an interesting, challenging and sometimes grueling job for Yancey.  Yancey's story is an interesting read for many reasons.  First, he is an excellent writer.  Second, the story he has to tell is interesting.  His co-workers were a collection of colorful souls, all flawed, none of them the straight-laced, buttoned up type.  Yancey also structures the story well and doesn't bore us with any memoir-style introspection.  The book is paced well.  Enjoy this one, despite any reservations you may have.	2004-07-24

Because it's well-written chick lit with a twist chick lit that will actually  make you smile, and sometimes even laugh out loud.  Sophie Stanton, the charming narrator of this novel is 36 and recently widowed.  Let me warn you, the first several chapters of this novel, while well-written and gently humorous, are sort of a downer--Sophie is pretty much miserable and her life is falling apart.  My advice:  try to read them in one sitting and get to the more middle parts of the novel, where she starts to get her act together.  You can breeze through this novel in a couple of hours.  Sophie is a wonderful character--likeable, you'll want to root for her.  A fun, light read.	2004-07-18

Amy Sutherland, a journalist from Maine, got invited to the Pillbury Bake Off rather serendipitously and decided to go, pretty much as a lark, figuring that it would prove an amusing piece of Americana.  Sutherland was surprised to discover an entire cookoff subculture, with an entertaining cast of characters and no shortage on drama.  Her experience at the Bake Off inspired her to spend over a year traveling around the country, spending time at cookoffs and time with contesters:  cookoff professionals, some of whom have won substantial sums of money for their devoted cooking efforts.  Each chapter focuses on either a particular cookoff, or a particular aspect of cookoffs, such as what happens when cheating occurs.  Sutherland is a wonderful writer, able to keep you in suspense (and actually make you care!) over who would actually each cookoff.  I really enjoyed reading this book; it is pretty much a refreshing change from anything I have read in a long time.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading about food.  Enjoy.	2004-06-12

This is a terrific novel that reminded me in many ways of Richard Russo's novels.  It is a novel full of lovable losers in deadend lives, and despite that, is still a joy to read.  The characters may be depressed, but, because Mark Spencer injects just enough humor into the novel, the reader is never depressed.  Spencer writes in a witty, wry style.  I hope to read more of Spencer's works.  I can't believe this one did not get more attention when it was published.  Enjoy.	2004-05-17

The writing is all internet communications--chat room transcripts and email--and begins in a chat room at literoticus.com.  The main \\"characters\\" are Tag and Lisa (the lisa33 of the title).  Tag is a lawyer in Massachusetts who says he is unhappy with his marriage.  Lisa is a stay-at-home mom in Georgia who is also unhappy with her marriage.  After meeting in the chatroom, they quickly form a bond that soon involves the email equivalent of phone sex.  This is a quick read about some pretty sad lives, although much of the writing is pretty funny.  Dan Allan comes up with some fast-paced chat room conversations, with many characters and multiple conversations that are pretty amusing, but like I said, these are some sad lives.  Because of the internet nature of the narrative, the characters are not fully developed in the sense that the reader can truly empathize with them, but because of the sad lives they lead, that is a good thing for the reader.  As I said before, this is a quick read with some witty writing.  Some of the internet sex can be fairly graphic, so if that is something you don't want to read, this book probably isn't a good idea for you.	2004-05-15

While the novel is good, it did not live up to my expectations, but I would still recommend it.  The story concerns Denny Roman at three points in her life.  We meet her at age twelve, where much of the focus in the narrative is on what happens to her mother on her 41st birthday.  We next meet Denny in her mid-twenties, as she returns to her native Ohio to sort through her things before her mother moves to New York City.  The final section of the novel takes place during Denny's mid-thirties, where she faces what could be a life-altering decision to assume responsibility for the son of a dear friend, Maureen.  The writing in What to Keep is excellent, but the novel lacks, I don't know, that little extra oomph for a five-star rating.  That being said, this novel is much, much better than most (if not all) chick lit, which apparently this novel is being marketed as.	2004-05-15

Each of these first-person narrative stories is just wonderful, not a weak link in the bunch.  Many times, I feel that a short story is a bit of an emotional letdown, but not in the case of these stories; each is emotionally rewarding.  Never will you wish that a story was a little longer, or had a bit more for you.  The writing here is excellent; the stories, compelling.  Silber makes it a little bit more interesting by linking each story to the ones surrounding it as placed in the book.  Well done. I highly recommend this collection, even if you generally shy away from short fiction.	2004-05-10

As the novel begins, Brian Jackson, the eighteen year old narrator of this charming novel is about to set off for university in England during the mid-1980s, leaving his widowed mother, friends and working class background.  Brian yearns to have knowledge, to learn, to have witty conversation, to meet that certain special gorgeous supremely intelligent someone.  He gets to college and spends a bit more time than he would like recovering from hangovers and pining away after Alice, the perhaps unattainable girl of his dreams.  He finally gets to fulfill a life-long dream:  he will represent his university on University Challenge, a quiz type game show.  This novel is funny, witty, heartwarming and endearing (but not sappy, not by a longshot).  It's great fun to read.  David Nichols is sort of like a British Tom Perrotta--he makes writing a funny and thoughtful novel look effortless.  Enjoy.	2004-05-10

It's an enjoyable read, filled with very funny episodes from Matti's life.  Matti grew up in the middle of nowhere in Sweden--he remembers the first paved roads coming into his town.  Matti also shares the first time he heard the Beatles and his antics in the local rock band.  Niemi throws a bit of almost magical realism or mysticism in the novel.  This is a charming and funny novel.  Enjoy.	2004-05-06

Is it the bug that has invaded a computer program designed by protagonist Ethan Levin in the mid-1980s, or is it also something less obvious, a deeper bug in Ethan's life.  Ethan is pretty much all work, no play, and he has the disintegrating life--love life, friendships--to prove it.  The program he has designed has a bug in it, a bug discovered by software tester Roberta Walton.  Ethan spends much of the novel tracking the bug down, and helped, at times, by Roberta.  The narrative moves forward on two paths--Roberta tells her side of the story from her 2000 vantage point, while an omniscient narrator fills us in on Ethan's disintegrating life.  This is a well written story--the plot isn't all that clever or unique, but neither is it predictable.  There is much in here of computer codes--but that shouldn't turn the computer neophyte off.  I am sure much of that went over my head, but don't think that affected my enjoyment of the novel.  The Bug is an entertaining, quick read.	2004-05-05

The novel is a journal of sorts that Stella Parrish has put together in contemplation of her last days of high school and her last days, she thinks, on earth.  Stella is a well-to-do orphan living in foster care in a wealthy California town.  She is bright, brilliant perhaps, but also alone and lonely.  She explains that she has no friends, merely a large collection of acquaintances who all assume her other acquaintances are her true friends.  As a narrator she is charming and tragic in the same sentence.  Stella is one of those high school over achievers--going to Princeton after she completes all of her AP classes.  Like the Red Panda can be bitterly funny at times--reading it is like spending time with a snide, observant and very funny teen--sort of like Stella.  Enjoy.	2004-05-05

The sisters live on their own--their father left years ago and then their mom died tragically in a car accident.  Mary Beth seeks to supplement their income using her talents as a song reader--sort of like a psychic, but instead of reading palms, she reads the songs people have in their heads.  This story isn't so much about Mary Beth as it is about Leeann and her growing up.  You will root for the sisters to succeed in both life and love in this enjoyable and engaging novel.	2004-05-04

Eric Schlosser's Reefer Madness has three interesting essays in it, but I can't quite figure out why the three are in this book together.  In the introduction to the book, Schlosser says his intent is to expose the underground economy of the US for what it is.  The first essay concerns marijuana and the ridiculous way it is handled in the US.  Next, he focusses on the miserable lives of migrant strawberry pickers.  Finally, he exposes the seedy underside of the American porn industry.  All three essays are interesting and provocative--the marijuana chapter may be viewed by some as especially controversial.  Schlosser's writing is well-researched and clear.  But, the book just doesn't hang together as a cohesive whole, which I think it could if he had given it a couple more drafts--it almost seems that this book was rushed out before it was truly finished.  Still--it is definitely worth the read.	2004-05-04

In the mid-1800s, several prominent native American leaders proposed a trade--one thousand white women for brides for the native Americans in exchange for one thousand horses.  As far as we know, the offer was never accepted, but Fergus takes the ball and runs with it.  One Thousand White Women is the story of May Dodd, a young women from Chicago who had been institutionalized by her family for &quot;promiscuity.&quot;  She had fallen in love with a man below her station and had two children before her family caught up with her.  Her participation in the &quot;exchange&quot; program offered her an escape from her wrongful detention.  Most of the other women in the program were similarly situated--women seeking escape from mental institutions, prisons, and other undesirable situations answer the call of their government to live with the Cheyenne.  May's adventure is interesting as well as heartbreaking.  She is a charming narrator and her story is full of ironic humor.  The writing at times can get a little clunky, but that is my only complaint about this engaging novel.	2004-05-03

Jayne Ann Krentz picks up right where she left off in Light in Shadow.  Zoe and Ethan Truax are still trying to see if their experimental marriage will work, all the while working on their respective careers as interior designer and private investigator.  Zoe's friend Arcadia begins to ge the feeling she's being watched and the romantic thriller takes off.  The pacing in this novel is a little off--the main conflict is resolved with about 50 pages left of the novel, and suddenly, there is another conflict that wasn't really hinted at earlier.  That, though is my only complaint about this enjoyable read.	2004-05-01

The novel mainly concerns Eloise--a misanthropic recluse given to hilarious rants--and her former lover George, who is just ever so slightly more social than Eloise.  The two are former lovers, haven't seen each other in years, and they each live in their separate worlds trying to avoid misery that company brings.  Sounds miserable, but it's truly funny.  As I said before, not for the faint of heart, but if you can take it, you'll love it.	2004-04-30

It's the 70s, New York City.  Her mother has run off, her father is recovering in an out-of-state institution.  The only person left to care for Alice is her half-sister \\"Aunt\\" Esme, aged 16.  At the start of the novel, Alice is observing Esme's decadence with two young men, one of whom periodically molests (and there is no other word for it, given her age) Alice.  Alice eventually becomes kind of a drag for Esme, so she sends her off to art camp in the south where she meets another child molester, who is also a drug dealer.  She somehow survives this all, including a 72 hour acid trip.  This novel is a bizarre bildingsroman--where world crashes into girl.  It is a disturbing, but oddly compelling story.  Alice is a fascinating character, maybe a bit too passive at times, but she is 11.  Her journey parallels that of Lewis Carroll's Alice and the other Alice from the Jefferson Airplane song.  This novel isn't an uplifting read, but as I said before, it's strangely compelling and certainly won't bore you.	2004-04-30

Patty has had a difficult life, her father died young, her abusive mother is an alcholic, her dangerous ex-boyfriend, and father of her child, just got out of prison and she has a difficult job.  The boyfriend wants her back, but her co-workers and her mother don't really want her, for various reasons.  Patty also struggles with her choice of career, lead singer in a small band doing pop song covers.  Most of the other members of the band would rather be playing jazz, but Patty wants whatever puts food on the table, which she thinks is pop and not jazz.  For all her difficulties, Patty is a charming narrator--her story keeps you reading.  The resolution of the novel is a bit predictable, but that's my only complaint about this engaging novel.	2004-04-29

David Kahn, a high school student, chemistry fan and Boy Scout in search of the Eagle Scout honor pretty much constructed a rudimentary nuclear reactor in his back yard potting shed in suburban Detroit, using old clocks and discarded smoke alarms, among other things.  Ken Silverstein takes this unbelievable story and fashions it into something the reader can believe, however scary that may be.  Silverstein tosses in much nuclear trivia and information that add to the story.  An enjoyable and scary read.  I am recommending it to all of my scientifically oriented friends.	2004-04-29

From the reviews on these pages, it is harder to find this book than it was for Jack and Eddie, the young boy and stuffed bear heroes of the book to solve the mysterious murders in Toy City.  Humpty Dumpty has been boiled to death--and other nursery rhyme protagonists soon follow.  Toy City is a bizarre place where toys are real, as are people and nursery rhymes and other oddities.  Jack is new to the town, and, like the reader, is perpetually amazed at the weirdness of Toy City.  This book is very, very funny--a bit (well, more than a bit) off center--but just a delight to read.  It's a blend of science fiction, fantasy, humor and mystery--somewhat like the Thursday Next series in its odd blending of multiple genres.  Fun, weird fun, but still fun.	2004-04-27

The Last Goodbye is a gripping, compelling read--but I have to say that after finishing it, I felt kind of like &quot;Is that all there is?&quot;  The story is essentially a good one--down on his luck lawyer's old friend dies of an overdose, or does he?  Friend investigates the murder, with the help of a cyberpunk client and discovers web of lies and deceit, while he may be falling in love with dead friend's obsessive love.  The dialogue works, the writing is good, but certain elements of the plot just didn't ring true and overall the plot seems like a rehash of other novels.  Still--this book would certainly be a fine companion on a long plane flight or in a boring waiting room--it will provide an excellent diversion--just not one you would feel like talking with your book club about.	2004-04-27

Smith was about 15 years old when her 18-year old brother was killed in a terrible car accident, leaving Smith as her parent's only child.  Smith recounts the three years following her brother Roy's death with heartbreaking honesty.  Smith had the double difficulty of trying to cope with her brother's death and her own identity at the same time.  The nuns in the Catholic high school tried their best to understand her, but in some ways, Smith fell through the cracks--parents assuming the nuns were taking care of her, and vice versa.  After Roy died, Smith's life moved forward, at sometimes an alarming rate.  Her life was difficult and joyous--and her memoir communicates that beautifully.  Smith is an excellent writer and this is an excellent memoir.	2004-04-23

John Rebus and his partner Siobhan Clarke set out to investigate why this man did what he did, all the while dealing with allegations that Rebus himself has murdered a local thug who had been harassing Clarke.  A Question of Blood explores the two mysteries, twines them togehter, all the while telling an excellent, compelling, gripping story.  Ian Rankin is a talented writer--the writing is good, the dialog is excellent and the story works, keeping you guessing up until the last pages of the novel.  This is the first of Rankin's novels that I have read and it certainly is impressive.  Rebus is an complicated and entertaining character--a bit of a cynic, and certainly not one to tow the line.  All in all, A Question of Blood is a terrific mystery.	2004-04-23

Jonathan Lethem's prose is wonderful--he really is the poet of Brooklyn.  The Fortress of Solitude is a coming of age novel and love song to Brooklyn rolled into one.  The story concerns the unlikely friendship of Dylan Ebdus and Mingus Rude, two young Brooklyn men, one white, one black, as they grow up in the seventies, obsessed at times with comic books, music, girls and the various other things young men obsessed over during those times.  Both are motherless boys with caring fathers who just cannot quite get it together.  They live independently, on the edge. The first half of the novel takes place during the seventies, after Dylan moves to Boerum Hill, his family one of the few white families there at the time.  He befriends Mingus, and other boys, having run-ins and problems, some typical of his age, others unique to the Brooklyn experience.  The second half of the novel takes place in 1999.  Dylan and Mingus are in their late 30s, but the novel briefly flashes back to the times in between, explaining how they got to where they are.  The writing here is always excellent and sometimes purely wonderful.  This is an enjoyable, big, wonderful and ambitious novel that succeeds on every level.  Enjoy.	2004-04-20

Many of them, while good, start to all sound alike, which is why I found The Sleeping Father.  Bernard is the father in question who unwittingly takes the wrong anti-depressant and falls into a coma.  While in the coma, and then in recovery, his teenaged children, Chris and Cathy, are left to cope with not only their father's recovery, but also the normal trials and tribulations of contemporary teens.  This novel is quirky, as are Chris and Cathy.  Some of their undertakings must be taken with a grain of salt, seen as fantasy rather than reality.  All in all, I think this novel is a departure from the typical book club selection.  Enjoy.	2004-04-20

All chapters are interesting, some more interesting than others--but that's probably going to depend on the reader's interest anyway.  The book delves into assumptions many of us take for granted (and the younger you are, the more of these assumptions you probably do take for granted).  For instance, what was music life like before the electric guitar.  If it weren't for Les Paul and other innovative musicians, we wouldn't have those fabulous guitar solos we so enjoy now.  Why does every suburban house have a lawn?  Did you ever stop to think about all of the changes the disposable diaper made possible?  This is an entertaining and thought-provoking book, if only because it makes you think a bit about various aspects of American culture and how they got they way they are.	2004-04-19

Jack first sees Chloe in a poetry class at Northwestern and is immediately taken with her.  He then casually pursues her, orchestrating several accidental meetings and ultimately the relationship takes off.  The action of the novel takes place after they move into their first apartment--a building with four flats.  Because Chloe works in a high-powered bank training program, it is Jack, who is &quot;working&quot; on a novel, who becomes entangled witht he lives of the other inhabitants of the building--each of whom are disturbing in their own way.  The novel starts off a little slowly, but once Thompson gets into the rhythm of their daily life in this apartment building, dealing with the obnoxious reggae cranking Rich upstairs, Rich's entourage of women,the racist across the hall--the pace picks up.  The writing here is excellent--certain passages Thompson writes are so witty, so observant, so dead on.  This is a terrific book.  Very well done.	2004-04-18

All of these essays are amusing, at a minimum and some are so unbelievable funny and just so on, that I still can't stop thinking of them.  She has a way of describing that sort of slow-paced walk people take, oh, right in front of your car when your light's green that is utterly perfect.

I have not yet seen any of his other cookbooks, but I found the approach this one took rather refreshing.  Unless absolutely  necessary, measurements in this one are more general (i.e. handful of breadcrumbs), which gives the chef a little more freedom.  He also adds a couple of suggestions at the end of each recipe where the chef can tweak it a bit and get something a bit different.  He includes some step by step instructions for things, such as making pasta.  The recipes in this book are, for the most part, an undertaking, simply not something you are going to whip together for your family of four after a long day at work or with the kids.

Reading this one is like sitting down with your best friend as she recounts running into an old flame--like gossip, only somehow more fun.  Shapiro decided to revisit all of her past loves after Brad--her old boyfriend from college and then some resurfaced in her life.  The memoir opens as she is trying to decide what to wear.  It's a funny scene and it sets the stage for the honest, open and very funny book.  She manages to track down the other four men in her love history she considered major heartbreakers and the memoir recounts everything--the courtships, the relationships, the breakups.  We finally get to the sixth guy--Aaron, the one who didn't break her heart, the one she married, and it all makes sense.  Shapiro shares much with us--she is a brave woman--I don't know many who would air their secrets as she did, but thank goodness she did.  This is a fun, entertaining read.

The novel follows Edward Wozny, a twenty something investment banker in New York who in two weeks is set to start a new job in London, but for the time being has been asked by a wealthy client to catalog a book collection.  Kind of a weird premise, but it quickly takes off.  He has been asked to keep an eye out for a particular work that he soon learns perhaps does not even exist.  In the meantime, an old college friend has drawn him into MOMUS, an addictive computer game that bears amazing similarities to the search for the elusive book, the codex.  Along the way, Edward enlists the help of Margaret Napier, a young woman much more qualified for the job he has undertaken than he is.  This book is a thrilling, addictive read and I confess, halfway through the book, I realized that there was a lot more going on than your average thriller, so I started the book again (I did that once before, with Infinite Jest).  There are so many layers in this novels, so many little themes.  It is possible to read this one as a simple thriller, and derive much pleasure from it, but the novel offers more than that.  I have seen it compared to Possession and The Name of the Rose--well, it's almost there and is much, much better than DaVinci Code, in terms of literary thrillers. Have fur with this one--it's great, right down to the last sentence, which will make you laugh out loud.	2004-04-15

Francesca Dunn is a rather ordinary 8th grader, with divorced parents, and perhaps some sort of eating disorder.  She works at a local diner serving food to the homeless and one of the men there--a kind man, but mentally unstable--believes that she is the Virgin Mary returned to earth.  He is convinced she has healed several of those around him and his beliefs start what becomes Francesca's cult following.  Many people attach on to Francesca in search of their own miracles--a financial turnaround, spiritual awakening, something.  Francesca's presence is merely a catalyst, not a &quot;miracle&quot;.  The story here is interesting, but frankly I think it lacked a certain extra something to make it really special.  It's a good quick read.	2004-04-13

The story follows Lucy, the young heroine in the novel, from about the ages of 14 to 16.  She lives with her mom while her dad works as a logger, visiting only intermittently.  She has only one close friend, a boy with whom she ultimately has what is pretty much an implausible physical relationship with.  He moves away, and she takes up with another young man.  Lucy is a fairly complicated character and I think Fromm does a very good job with her, other than her relationship with the young men--that struck me as a male fantasy more than anything else.  Still--the novel kept me reading--the story is interesting and entertaining--a quick and easy read.	2004-04-13

Stockler's experience is a little different than most dads, however.  While his wife is a high-powered lawyer at a Manhattan law firm, Stockler is the one who eventually stays home with the kids.  They start out in Manhattan in a small apartment, but eventually move to the suburbs.  Stockler's story is very funny and heartwarming.  ONe of the things that makes this book work is Stockler's almost brutal honesty--he sugarcoats nothing--not his relationship with his wife or his feelings for his kids.  His life has not been picture-perfect in the Norman Rockwell sense, but there is a lot of love in that Stockler family and Stockler shares it with us well.  Enjoy.	2004-04-12

Two young friends on a camping trip and one of them winds up dead of a supposed mercy killing by the other.  The book does not disappoint.  It recounts the tale honestly and fairly of the two men whose overnight camping trip in the Southwest went horribly wrong--and the aftermath that followed.  Jason Kersten writes well.  The book reads like a compelling magazine article--but the story clearly merits a full-sized book.  Kersten stays focussed on the story and thankfully does not take any tangents to fill page space.  Enjoy.	2004-04-08

I think those words of warning are important for anyone reading this powerful, flawed memoir.  From reading other reviews, it seems many are upset by his version of being a marine, but I think it is important to remember that this is as he remembers his experience.  What he did experience--the Gulf War, a difficult childhood, death of close friends--is enough to warp the mind.  What Swofford has given us here is a powerful memoir, a look into a world that many of us do not have a chance to see.  He lets us into his head and helps non-jarheads to understand, at least to certain extent, what his experience was.  Swofford is honest with us--he and his friends are far from perfect and he doesn't try to sugar coat anything.  The writing at times can be a bit uneven--it's  not all as powerful as it could be.  That being said, this is an interesting look into the life of one jarhead.	2004-04-06

Her story of Hugo Whittier, a likeable misanthrope is addictive, engaging and so well-written.  Hugo is a great character--he's got tremendous flaws, but you can't hate him, he's just too charming.  At the start of the novel, he is living out what he believes to be his final days as his family home in New York state.  He smokes (and the cigarettes are literally killing him), he cooks and his sole human contact appears to be with the checkout girl who sells him his cigarettes.  He enjoys his solitude immensely and is thus unhappy that his older brother,  Dennis has moved back into the home after his own marriage breaks up.  Dennis' return is just the beginning, Hugo's wife and daughter return, as does an older uncle.  Christensen handles this all well, there is nothing cute about all these people showing up at this home, probably because there is nothing cute about Hugo.  Hugo is forced to make more forays into the outside world.  He is a wonderful cynic, it's a pleasure to get inside his head.  Very well done.  Enjoy.	2004-04-05

That's the natural response when someone hears of lurid stories on the news similar to that of the novel What Was She Thinking?  In the novel, Sheba Hart, a forty-something teacher has an affair with a student at her school.  The novel does not, as you might expect, tell us what Sheba was thinking at all, rather, Zoe Heller has focused on the thoughts of Barbara Covett, a sixty-something teacher at the school where Sheba also teaches.  She is the narrator, and we get into her brain, so much so that the story isn't really about Sheba and young Steven Connolly, but about poor Barbara.  Barbara has never married, has no friends, and is basically a social misfit.  She is not the sort of person anyone would really choose to be friends with, but her position lends itself to an ability to tell a compelling story--about herself.  She becomes obsessed with Sheba, even before she realizes what Sheba is doing with the student.  The novel is really about their relationship, how it develops, and why, at least from Barbara's perspective, it develops.  What Was She Thinking is a fascinating character study and moral tale that is reminiscent of Iris Murdoch's novels, as well as Ishiguro's Remains of the Day.  I was very impressed with this novel, particularly because I thought it was just going to be about this student-teacher affair, when in reality, that affair serves as a springboard for a much deeper, more interesting story.	2004-03-30

Only condiments and beer in the refrigerator,  total commitment-phobe, inconsiderate at times, likes to drink.  There's nothing all that unique about Tom, but as the narrator of Love Monkey, he is terrifically funny.  This novel will make you laugh out loud (warning:  not all jokes here are politically correct).  The story is not all that original.  Tom essentially spends the whole novel pining away over Julia, a woman he probably will never have.  In that aspect, Love Monkey is a refreshing change from the romantic comedy, chick lit brand of novels (which I love, don't get me wrong) in that this isn't a fairy tale with a fairy tale ending.  It's just a very funny book.  The plot can get weak at times, however any novel that is as funny as this ones deserves all five stars.  Enjoy the laughter.	2004-03-29

Stiff is a very interesting, and certainly unique read--certainly not for the squeamish or faint of heart.  But it's funny, surprisingly funny.  Mary Roach also manages to communicate much respect for those who have gone before us.  Her humor works because she generally pokes fun at the living and, she's pretty funny.  There is nothing offensive in here, just lots interesting facts, some fascinating, some weird, some surprising.  If you are the slightest bit curious about the topic, give this one a try.	2004-03-26

When, as a young man, he appears old, he cannot enjoy his youth.  Then, when he is nearing death, he instead becomes an ever-shrinking version of himself.  His family rejects him and his only friend is an oddity himself.  The true trajedy of Max's life, according to Max, is that he loses Alice, the love of his life not once but twice.  Social conventions forbid an &quot;older&quot; man such as himself to love the teenaged Alice, although in reality they are only a few years apart.  They meet again when their apparent ages are closer, but the relationship is doomed, it has to be, just as Max's life is doomed--he knows when his life will end.  This is a well-done novel--Max's time-warped life is never overly-gimmicky or silly seeming.  The imagery is dark and dreary--as Max views his life.  This isn't a novel I would suggest reading if you are in need of a quick pick-me-up.  Rather, it is one to be read if you are in search of something a little different, a little off-center.	2004-03-26

It's not a novel in the traditional sense of the word, really a group of well-written stories with characters in each story popping up in the others.  All of the stories focus on the relationship between parents and children, exploring the nature of the desire for becoming a parent--is it something innate, something we all have?  Are some better parents than others, or are they all bad in their own way?  The writing here is wonderful--very enjoyable.  A well-done collection that hangs together much more cohesively than most other interconnected story collections I have read.	2004-03-26

The Birth of Venus, for me at least, got off to a kind of slow start.  The story of Alessandra, a young woman in turbulent Florence dragged at first, but then, somewhere about 100 pages in, I couldn't put it down--the story got juicy, a little twisted, interesting.  What kept me going, really, were the opening paragraphs, which tell the story of a recently deceased nun, who, upon her death, reveals something no one knew of her in life--that her torso was covered with a huge, serpent shaped tatoo.  The suspense of what exactly what that was, and how it came about kept me reading Alessandra's story and I am glad I persevered.  The Birth of Venus is an enjoyable story--a quick read that once you get into, you won't be able to put down.	2004-03-22

How is this one going to work?  Well, let me tell you it works and it works really well.  I literally could not put this one down.  How could I have forgotten the fact that I love time travel fiction (Time and Again, Replay), and who doesn't enjoy a really well-done romance (I'm thinking along the lines of Possession).  Anyway, the story of Henry and Clare is an addictive, compelling read, a beautiful, intriguing and different love story.  Enjoy.	2004-03-22

Lewis and Sigmund Freud Debate God, Love, Sex, and the Meaning of Life	Books	5	13	15	N	N	Fascinating Reading	Armand Nicholi teaches a college course comparing the philosphies of C.S. Lewis and Sigmund Freud--their approaches to God, love, etc., all as revealed in the title of this wonderfully interesting book.  Professor Nicholi has taken the course and turned it into this very readable book.  Although they probably never met, Nicholi has constructed a dialogue or debate--Lewis v. Freud.  I will tell you straight out, Lewis clearly has the upper hand in this book, but that is probably more of a function of his surviving Freud and respoding to his writings, and Nicholi's own biases.  That does not detract at all from this fascinating book.  I think anyone interested in the question of God and the importance of religion in contemporary society will find this book interesting and compelling reading.  Much of the background material may be repetitive to those who know much of the lives of these two men, but for anyone even mildly curious about these two men, this book should be a great place to start.	2004-03-22

Ron Clark, who is apparently a highly successful teacher, has set out 55 rules of his classroom he believes are the key to his and his student's success.  Some of the advice is useful, if obvious (look your teacher in the eye, address teachers with &quot;sir&quot; and &quot;maam&quot;.  Some of the advice is weird--like always tipping in hotels and the length of time a group of students should applaud when congratulating a fellow student.  The essence of this slim book could easily be distilled into a useful Parent's Magazine article--I'm not sure it warrants an entire book.	2004-03-19

Unlike the goldfish, however, Little Children also contemplates larger issues.  Perrotta is a master.  Little Children is funny (laugh-out-loud at certain points), engaging, compelling while also being thought-provoking.  I finished this book over two weeks ago, yet the characters and their decisions in the novel still haunt me.  The main characters, Sarah and Todd, are two thirty-something suburban parents who are, for varying reasons, unhappy with their lives.  Todd and Sarah meet at a town playground and from there, the relationship develops and pretty much serves as the unifying thread throughout the novel.  Perrotta manages to create well-rounded, flawed characters with a sympathetic eye.  We can somehow forgive them for their flaws and mistakes because we can understand why they do what they do.  Little Children is truly an enjoyable and satisfying read--a rare thing.  The ending is terrific.  I thought there were one of two things that could happen at the end, and I wasn't sure which I preferred.  Perrotta had a different idea and took the characters in another direction (a believable one) entirely.  I recommend this novel very highly.	2004-03-18

Pity poor Annabelle--a young, aspiring poet at a prestigous NY university who thinks she is the luckiest poet in the world when she lands the &quot;dream&quot; job of assistant to Z., a highly praised contemporary poet.  Annabelle is so enthralled with Z. that she doesn't seem to mind the ridiculous demands Z. makes of her, doesn't seem to mind that so many of those demands are impossible to live up to.  Annabelle finally sees the truth in Z., but not before she has been taken advantage of--the reader sees it coming long before Annabelle realizes it.  Weinstein does an excellent job with this novel and her characters because, as horrible as Z. is, she has a number of redeeming qualities that make Annabelle want to remain at her job.  She isn't portrayed as so ridiculously horrible that no one in their right mind would ever work for her.  The story is told with much wit and humor.  Weinstein does not think very highly of much of academia and her send up here is quite amusing.  The prose is pretty spare, but gets her point across excellently.  Enjoy.	2004-03-16

(I'm thinking something along the lines of James Frey's A Million Little Pieces).  Land certainly lived through not one but two harrowing experiences as a relatively young man.  First, he is kidnapped and brutally beaten in his home town and then has a collection of horrible experiences as a fraternity pledge.  That Land has gotten enough distance from these experiences to write about them is commendable.  However, I kept feeling that the book lacked a certain raw power, that Land was somehow holding back.  The minimalist writing style he uses lacks a little oomph.  The book is a quick and compelling read--especially if you are curious about the goings on in a college fraternity.  I see in these reviews that there are many who question the veracity of Land's recount of his pledge experience, but I think that questioning somehow misses the point. Land clearly had a difficult time in his late teens and early twenties--he has recorded it as he remembers it, as it affected him.  I don't think this can be read as a searing indictment on American fraternity life and I don't think it's meant to be one.  This is a man, working through his own demons, using his writing to put his own past in the past.	2004-03-15

It's science fiction in that it takes place in the distant future when individual consciousness can be downloaded into a new body (or sleeve) should the need ever arise.  There is plenty of space travel as the protagonist and narrator, Takeshi Kovacs travels from his world to what we know as earth.  Altered Carbon is also a crime novel, as Kovacs has been hired to find the &quot;murderer&quot; of a centuries old wealthy man, who's consciousness was simply downloaded into a newly cloned sleeve.  The story is well-written, compelling reading.  Very enjoyable and imaginative.	2004-03-15

The novel opens on a beautiful sunny day, in which a young man proceeds to commit suicide in the middle of a public park.  Erast Fandorin, a young, naive and utterly charming young man, who is perhaps the Russian equivalent of a police detective, suspects that there is more to this suicide than meets the eye.  His investigation takes him all over Europe and risks his life at several instances.  Erast finally gets to the bottom of the forces behind the suicide and it is delightful reading following him there.

The great thing is that it all works.  We are in the distant future where the human race as we know it has essentially vanished from the Earth, replaced by humanish peoples who all live to be 100 and travel around the earth by fax.  Death, as we know it now is unknown to them.  On Mars, some form of supergods have somehow managed to reenact the events of the Iliad with the help of reincarnated human scholars.  There are plenty of other story lines and details included in this big novel, I cannot do justice to them in this limited space.  I will say that Ilium is a big, enjoyable read which should please science fiction fanss and neophytes to the genre as well.	2004-03-09

Jasper Fforde has again provided us with an engaging tale, narrated by Thursday Next, a SpecialOps literary detective who inhabits a parallel universe where time travel is prevalent and literature has great value.  Thursday's problem this time is that her husband has been kidnapped and is being held hostage.  As Thursday tries to rescue him, she finds help along the way with Great Expectation's Miss Havisham.  They jump from book to book, even to a care label, to rescue her beloved.  This book is just fun to read, never serious, always tongue-in-cheek.  My favorite character is her time-travelling father, who pops in to see her occasionally, always with a little gem for the reader.  At one point, he asks her if she has heard of Winston Churchill yet.  When she says no, he time travels away with more work to do.  This one is great fun.  Enjoy.	2004-03-08

I hate to even say that because I sound like an uptight party-pooper, but many of these recipes cook with lard or bacon fat--I was a little shocked.  Needless to say, there isn't any nutritional information about these recipes either.  That being said, this is a beautiful cookbook with many interesting and traditional recipes.	2004-03-05

Joe Conanson has given you a voice, he's fighting back and he's got facts to back him up.  The next time some conservative starts in on how liberals are out of touch with reality and how fabulous conservatives all, you can now counter with the notion that his or her comments are all based on, well, big lies.  The sad thing is because he is able to back up his assertions with facts, you'll get a little depressed again.  Conanson makes clear that he right wing has warped so much of what is out there, twisted it to advance their own agenda while hiding their own misdeeds and after a while, reading this one gets a little scary.  However, read on.  Conanson puts forth sane, well-reasoned, well-constructed, well-written arguments for why so many conservative positions, particularly about the more liberal elements of our society, are misguided or just plain wrong.  Conanson is a voice of reason rising above all the name-calling and baseless assertions.  I have read the latest from both Michael Moore and Al Franken and, while I agree with much of what both of them are saying as well, I think that Conanson's book is probably the best for the non-left-leaning readers to pick up.  This is an important book, particularly because it is an interesting read--no dry politics here.	2004-03-02

As an indication--I read this novel in one day, and it was a work day.  A word of advice to anyone reading this novel--try to make sure someone else you know has already read it.  That way, when you come to the ending, there will be someone around for you to discuss it with.  The novel begins as two detectives are headed towards an small island to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a convicted murderer at a psychiatric institute.  The plot just takes off from there.  After a couple of twists, you'll wonder just where this whole thing is headed.  I had a couple of possible scenarios running through my head.  There was one in particular where I thought &quot;If this is where, he's going, I'll be so angry, it won't work.&quot;  Well, that's Lehane went, but the astonishing thing he makes the ending work.  It's ambiguous, for the most part, but that's why I recommend you know someone else who has read this novel before you crack it open.  You will need to talk about it.	2004-02-27

My main complaint about this collection is that the recipes do not include any nutritional information, although it's pretty easy to tell that most of these recipes will not show up in the pages of Cooking Light, unless it's in the recipe rescue section.  That being said, this book is filled with recipes that have good short cuts and Byrn provides many useful hints that are adaptable to more healthier recipes, just don't expect to find any guidance in this book on how to get there.	2004-02-20

I imagine, based on some of the reviews I have read here, that there are other novels in the Inspector Wexford series that are stronger, but as I have no frame of reference for this series, other than this one novel, I cannot comment as to that.  What I can comment to is the fact that Babes in the Woods is a well-written, well-plotted and well-paced mystery.  It kept me guessing throughout the novel and the ending made sense without being predictible or overly foreshadowed.  The story concerns the disappearance of two teens and their adult babysitter over the course of a rainy weekend.  Their mother returns home and jumps to the conclusion that the pair have drowned.  As the novel continues, there are many other conclusions reached and discarded, leads followed and abandoned.  Babes in the Wood is an excellent mystery and an enjoyable read.	2004-02-20

It's a lively, well-written story about the planning of the Chicago World's Fair, intertwined with the story of H.H. Holmes, the mass murderer who committed many of his crimes in his hotel of horrors not far from the site of the fair.  Larson tells the story of Daniel Burnham, the architect who essentially got the seemingly impossible accomplishment of the fair itself accomplished.  The stories of the fair, and of Burnham's effort are inspiring. Holmes' story, which is always lurking in the background is disturbing, yet never does it sink to any sort of lurid level.  The book is a compelling read.  I have read several reviewers comments here that they were dissappointed that Larson never managed to quite tie the two stories together.  Personally, I think they were linked enough and were told in a manner that kept the narrative flow moving along.  I generally don't read nonfiction, but I found this book very enjoyable, very readable.	2004-02-20

The novel is narrated by Teresa, whose older brother Jesse, was killed in 1968. Thirty years later, her mother hears Jesse's voice calling to her and she ultimately decides that she must go to the Vietnam War Memorial Wall in Washington.  The trip and the events leading up to it are difficult, bringing up painful memories of Jesse and their own lives before and after his death.  The trip and what they find when they get there will change their lives completely.  Let Their Spririts Dance is a satisfying, moving read.	2004-02-06

It is a thought-provoking collection of essays disguised as a novel.  In that same way, this novel isn't really 'about' a fictional character named Elizabeth Costello, it's about J.M. Coetzee himself.  Coetzee uses the fictional construct of the Costello character to convey these essays--and in some instances uses other characters to criticize these essays.  It's a very interesting approach and it works--which I think says a lot for Coetzee's talents.  My favorite chapter is the last one, where Costello thinks she has died, and death becomes almost Kafkaesque.  Costello is annoyed.  She dislikes Kafka--her experiences in this 'afterlife' are at once brilliant and very funny.  If you are in the mood for an intellectual challenge, and don't feel the need for a plot, Elizabeth Costello will suit your needs.	2004-02-05

He had skipped bail in four states, he was an alcoholic, drug addict and had managed to alienate pretty much everyone who ever cared for him.  Yet, those who cared never fully gave up on him, because perhaps they could see the nugget of genius that gave us this powerful memoir.  While I cannot speak to those who have lived through the horrors that Frey recounts as he goes through detoxification and rehab--this book may have a different effect for them and I have seen some reviews here who just aren't buying what he has to day--to most who pick up this work--this will be an amazing read.  Frey's recount of his time in rehab is almost hypnotic, is addictive in itself.  The writing is different, almost disjointed, but it works.  At the beginning of the book, he recounts his experience getting root canal without pain killers--it is a powerful and evocative passage.  There are several other sections of this book that I don't think I will ever forget, simply because of the power of his writing.  I don't normally read memoirs--I picked this one up on a lark.  It's a quick read, not quick because it is &quot;easy&quot;, but quick because you will need to know how James got through rehab.	2004-02-05

It's a pseudo-autobiography of sorts, narrated omniciently, telling the life story of Daisy Goodwill Flett, a woman born in 1905.  It's a cleverly told tale, not experimental really, just a bit different.  Every once in a while Daisy intrudes as an active narrator, but for the most part the narrator separates herself from actually having lived the story.  Daisy leads an ordinary life, full of both good and bad times, she marries, has children, grows older, nothing special or unique really, yet the story of her life, the way it is told to us, is special, is unique.  Reading the novel is almost like flipping through a family photo album--stories begin, lead back into the past, come back to the present--yet, the narrative voice is so strong and clear in the novel, that you won't ever lose your way.  This is a wonderful novel.  Enjoy.	2004-01-29

The story is indeed clever, and frankly, I liked the ending in the novel more than the one we see in the fairy tale.   However, there is nothing in the writing that distinguishes it from the rest of the pack.  The writing just plods along and much of the novel is spent on setting up the inevitable conclusion.  While Iris, one of the stepsisters, has her strengths, I found most of the characters in here pretty unsympathetic.  The only thing that kept me reading was my curiousity regarding how Maguire was going to make this whole thing work, which is, as I said before, done very cleverly.	2004-01-21

Sean isn't interested, Jimmy really wants to and Dave will do anything Jimmy wants.  They get into a fight and are stopped by men who purport to be police officers.  The men coerce Dave into their car, while Jimmy and Sean do nothing to stop what they know in their hearts is a kidnapping.  Dave escapes after 4 days--but none of those boys' lives is ever the same.  Fast forward 15 years--Jimmy is an ex-con, Sean is a homicide detective and Dave's life is really a series of mistakes and bad choices.  They are all living their separate lives until the brutal murder of Jimmy's 19 year old daughter throws them together again.<br />Mystic River is a truly a thrilling thriller.  The writing is terrific, it pulls you in immediately and keeps you reading.  It's quick, snappy and smart, a notch above most other thrillers out there.  The three men are all believable, well-developed characters, as are many of the other players in the novel.  Mystic River is an excellent, diverting read.  Enjoy.	2004-01-21

The novel begins as five condemned French soldiers walk to their doom during World War I.  They have all shot themselves, trying to get out of fighting and as punishment, will be thrown into the no-man's-land between the French trenches and the German trenches.  Their families know nothing of this and after they die, are told them men died honorably.  A few years later, Mathilde, the fiance of one of the men discovers some of the truth about what happened and she becomes convinced that her fiance has did not die--or at least did not die as she was told.  She tries, doggedly, to uncover the truth.  Along the way, she discovers many atrocities of that war.  The novel pulls you along to its rather unexpected, yet still deeply satisfying ending, pulls you so much you won't be able to put this one down.  The power of love, the strength of friendship, the failure of memory--all these come into play in this outstanding novel.  I highly recommend this novel to all devoted readers.  It's a bit of a challenge, following all the little clues Matilde gets, putting the truth together and tossing out the lies, but it's worth it.  Enjoy.	2004-01-14

The novel, which concerns high school student Elizabeth Clarry, is told entirely in letters, a construct that works naturally here.  Elizabeth is an aspiring long distance runner who (like most teens) feels that somehow she doesn't fit in.  Her best friend, Celia has disappeared (again), her father has reappeared on the scene, Elizabeth has discovered a boy on her school bus and found a new pen pal friend from across town as part of an English project.  The novel is warm and amusing.  It's not quite as sophisticated as Sloppy Seconds, as an example, but is still quite fun.  Enjoy.	2004-01-14

The novel concerns the disappearance of a young girl in 1963 rural England.  Evidence surrounding her disappearance leads everyone to believe she has been murdered, despite the lack of a body.  The book flap reveals that many years after the crime is &quot;solved&quot;, new evidence is revealed that changes the whole story.  Therefore, as you read the novel, you wonder whodunnit, but on two levels.  Who will be found guilty, but then, who really did it.  The novel succeeds in keeping your interest and with its &quot;surprise&quot; ending that is at once believable and satisfying.  A Place of Execution is an excellent read.  I highly recommend this novel if you are in the market for crime fiction.  Enjoy.	2003-12-29

Nelson decided to read a book a week for the entire 2002 calendar year and write about it.  What she has written is a thoroughly engaging work, delightful to read, if only because all those addicted to reading will find they are not alone. Each week, the book or books she reads (or doesn't read) send her on a reverie about aspects of reading, aspects of life that at times had me thinking &quot;I thought I was the only one who did this/thought this.&quot;  The little habits of devoted readers are exposed for the world to see.  Nelson discusses, or at least refers to, a number of books, most of which a devoted reader will have at least heard of, if not already read.  She's got strong opinions, some of which I personally agreed with, even rejoiced in (finally, someone who admits Tuesdays with  Morrie is a disappointment), others I did not agree with at all (Empire Falls being hard to get through).  Reading this book is a thoroughly enjoyable experience, like sitting down for a long dinner with a fellow booklover and having terrific conversation into the wee hours of the night.  If you love to read, if you have piles of books next to your bed that you are going to read &quot;next&quot;, if you cannot walk out of a bookstore without at least one purchase for yourself, if you religiously read book reviews and surf around amazon.com's book section, you will love this book.

There are certain elements in the US who will most likely throw this book across the room in anger after perhaps, oh, 50 pages or so because Michael Moore did not write Dude, Where's My Country to reach out to all readers.  He wrote the book, I think, to reach out to, and mobilize, those who feel that Bush and his cronies are doing this nation untold harm and need to be stopped.  He wrote this book to make those on the liberal end of the spectrum to feel empowered, to realize that most of the country agrees with them, they just don't realize it yet.  That being said, he certainly doesn't say anything nice about conservatives and much of what he says will certainly infuriate many of those on the right.  So what do you think of that?  If you are thinking, &quot;You go, Mike&quot;, well, rush right out and buy this book, you will love it, it will be empowering.  If, on the other hand, his approach makes your blood boil, don't read it, log on to townhall.com and read some of their tirades until you feel better.  This book is just not for you.  Whereas I would recommend Al Franken's Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell them to virtually all American voters, this one is just for the liberal leaning.  Moore starts the book with 7 questions for George Bush such as what's the story with the business relationship with his family and the bin Ladens.  He doesn't stop there, but goes on, dissecting various lies from Bush and his buds, tells us what he's going to do with the money he's gotten from the tax cut (very funny, I won't give it away), as well as suggests a number of candidates for president.  This is at times amusing and at all times entertaining and informative.  It's got some information in there that will break your heart if you care about this country, as he clearly does and I challenge anyone who says that he doesn't.  Patriotism isn't about blindly following policies you believe in your heart are misguided.  Patriotism is about daring to try to make your country a better, and that's what Dude, Where's My Country is all about.  But, as I have said above, it will infuriate all non-liberals, so if you fall into that camp, proceed at your own risk.	2003-11-19

Police Chief Kevin Kerney thinks he is about to take a well-deserved vacation with his very pregnant wife, when a series of murders and other horrors draw him back to the job.  Kerney begins to suspect, and rightly so, that he and his loved ones may be the ultimate target, because, as the assailant keeps telling him &quot;everyone dies.&quot;  This novel is intricate and well-plotted, a very enjoyable read.	2003-10-30

The story concerns several intertwining relationships that span the late 1930s through present day England.  The novel opens as Jamie Matthewson, world-renowned climber falls to his death in a climb he was sure to fail at.  His old, somewhat estranged friend Rob Dewar hears of the accident over the radio in his car, and immediately heads to attend the funeral and Jamie's wife and mother, to the displeasure of his wife.  Rob's return to the climbing world he left behind years ago forces him to recall, for our benefit, his relationship with Jamie and the reasons for its disintegration.  Rob's story involves not only Jamie and Rob, but the relationship of all of their parents many years ago.  The narrative shifts between Rob's first-person explanation of the Jamie-Rob years and a third-person narrative of their mothers' friendship and various loves during World War II England.  The Fall is a fascinating look at many &quot;falls&quot;--falling to one's death, falling in and out of love, falling into sin, the fall of one's life.  It's a compelling, well-written read.  Enjoy.	2003-10-27

I don't believe that all who read this book will agree with all Franken has to say, however, I think that what he is saying in this work is so important, it must be read.  It can open up a meaningful dialogue among the various right and left factions of the US.  Franken (and his team of Harvard graduate students) has put together a thoughtful look at media coverage of the US political scene and then goes on to critique the Bush administration.  Is there a media bias towards liberals in this country, as so many conservatives claim?  Franken comes up with an answer (I won't give it away).  Franken does an excellent job of dissecting various right wing mouthpieces, such as Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly, and exposing them for what they truly are.  I cannot urge people strongly enough to read this book.  If you care about the US, I must warn you that this book will probably upset you a bit because the truths Franken uncovers are, well, pretty depressing at times.  Franken has put together a very readable, very informative look at contemporary media and the Bush administration that is not to be missed.	2003-10-27

I always have my doubts about any book with this much hype and for the first part of the novel, I was not impressed at all.  The novel, as you probably know, concerns a man who tries to teach his dog, the sole witness to his wife's death, to talk so that he can understand if Lexy, his wife, fell to her death accidentally, or if it was suicide.  The novel is really about Paul, the husband, and his attempts to deal with his searing grief--the talking dog is just a gimmick, and for most of the novel, a rather annoying one at that.  Paul, our narrator, shifts back and forth in time, trying to make some sense of his wife's death.  He reveals truths to us slowly, and readers will most likely change their opinion as the novel goes on about the true nature of Lexy's death.  The pacing in the novel is excellent, the writing, strong.  It's not the best novel ever, not even the best one I've read this year.  It is an engaging and entertaining read from a promising writer.	2003-07-30

Liars and Saints concerns several generations of the Santerre family, beginning in the 40s, when Yvette, the matriarch is honest with her husband about something that unfortunately has subtle, yet devastating consequences.  Yvette's experiences with that one truth cause her to withhold much from her husband, her children and her grandchildren over the years.  This is a fabulous novel, in part because it covers so much ground with a marvelous economy of words.  Meloy doesn't bore us with the long, drawn out descriptions of every incident, every scene, every setting, yet she gets her point across and then some.  This is a terrific read--fast, yet utterly satisfying.  Enjoy.	2003-07-30

It is a novel to be savored and enjoyed.  The novel focuses on Michael, a professional violinist in his mid-thirties who is still dwelling on Julia, a love he lost by his own foolishness ten years ago.  He is a member of a critically acclaimed, if not completely financially successful string quartet and has a rather strained, yet still loving relationship with his father.  He's having an affair with one of his students who is 15 years his junior.  That is essentially his life.  Music, and memories of Julia, rule his world.  One day, after a performance, Julia, who he hasn't seen or spoken with in ten years, appears backstage and she re-enters his life again.  She is married, with a young son, but Michael soon discovers she is hiding a devastating secret.  This novel is beautifully written and reminds me in some ways of the novels of A.S. Byatt.  My only complaint is that the relationship between Michael and Julia at times does not ring true.  Other than that, a wonderful novel.  Enjoy.	2003-07-26

Mark Haddon's story, narrated by an autistic teenager is really amazing.  Christopher Boone is out walking in the middle of the night when he discovers that a dog on his street has been murdered with a pitchfork.  Despite his father's warnings to mind his own business, Christopher is determined to solve the mystery of who killed the dog and is equally determined to write it all down and his writings become the novel.  The novel really isn't about this poor dog, rather, it's about Christopher, his life, his family, his school, his thought-processes.  I confess, I don't know much more about autism than what I have read in various magazine articles, but Christopher's voice is certainly convincing, which is quite an amazing accomplishment.  Christopher is brilliant in many aspects--mathmatically and logically, nothing can get past him and yet emotionally he is in the dark.  Christopher acknowledges his shortcomings and explains them, very logically.  Haddon's undertaking is intriguing--a novel narrated by an autistic--and he carries it off very, very well.

I wouldn't however recommend Wandering Hill to anyone who didn't enjoy Sin Killer, nor would I recommend it to anyone who only wants to read another Lonesome Dove.  The Berrybender Narratives are a group of novels unto themselves, not really like anything else McMurtry has ever done.  McMurtry's excellent writing is still there and the novel will certainly make you chuckle.  Sin Killer had a more thematically pulled together feel, while The Wandering Hill does wander, as it were, a bit more.  We meet up with the Berrybenders and there varied entourage at a trading post in the American west in the 1830s.  Tasmin and her husband Jim, have a bit of a spat and he takes off into the wilderness, leaving a pregnant Tasmin to fend for herself.  Lord Berrybender is still his same eccentric self and the rest of the characters are equally as nutty.  Some bits of the writing isn't quite as strong as it should be, but all in all, this is still a strong novel and worth reading if it is what you are looking for.	2003-07-20

The novel doesn't have much of what one would call a plot, but rather contains a series of vignettes in which Mma Ramotswe recounts various clients she has helped in her detective work.  She is an unconventional detective, and goes about solving the riddles posed to her in surprising ways.  She also shares her personal history, telling us how she got to where she is.  It is a charming tale, charming and enjoyable.	2003-07-20

I had recently finished My Year of Meats which I thought was overly preachy and I was concerned that All Over Creation would be more of same, but Ozeki's terrific writing prompted me to give it a try.  I am quite glad I did.  All Over Creation is really a wonderful read, a wonderful story with an important message.  The novel takes place in Power County, Idaho, potato country.  Yumi Fuller has just returned home with her three children (who all have different fathers) after being summoned by Cass, an old friend, to care for her parents who are both ill.  Yumi left about 25 years early, ran away, and hadn't returned.  Her friendship with Cass has soured by now, as has her relationship with her parents.  Into the mix toss a band of environmental activists who come to Yumi's parent's farm, seeking guidance from Lloyd, Yumi's dad, based on his writings in seed catalogues.  The activists, The Seeds of Resistance, are waging a war against genetically engineered crops.  Then comes Elliot Rhodes, Yumi's old boyfriend, who does PR for those companies that sell the seeds for the crops to the farmers.  Much happens in the novel.  It has a very interesting, engaging and entertaining (and educational) story.  Enjoy.	2003-07-20

It is a wacky, genre-busting novel that takes place in a barely recognizable recent past.  The year is 1985 and we are in an England where literature is taken very seriously, so seriously that there is a special branch of the government policing its integrity.  That's where Thursday comes in, Thursday Next, out heroine in this wacky novel.  She is trying to track down a vicious killer and manipulater of respected literature.  She somehow winds up inside Jane Eyre and if Fforde is to be believed, we have Thursday to thank for the satisfying ending of that novel.  Throughout all this novel, we have Thursday's time traveling father popping in and out at various times for comic relief and various other amusing subplots.  This novel is a lot of fun.  Place your toungue firmly in your cheek and give it a whirl.	2003-07-16

Light and lighthearted, the novel is the perfect beach read.   It's a great romance with a compelling plot that will keep you reading.  No new ground is broker here, but,  so what?  The novel is still a lot of fun.  The novel concerns Genevieve Terrence, a young secretary with a huge crush on her boss, Nick.  Nick takes her and Jack Farley, one of the computer nerds at work, on an overnight business trip.  The trip winds up being not all it should be and Jack and Gen wind up stranded on a remote desert island, and...well, what do you think happens?  Gen and Jack's story is entertaining, as is the subplot of those looking for them.  If you are looking for a fun read that you shouldn't have to take too seriously, here it is.  Have fun.	2003-07-16

They soon discover, however, a hidden treasure of banned Western classics, and that changes everything.

The novel has a wonderful flow, and moves back and forth among a number of characters all in search of some relationship-related satisfaction while all chasing satisfaction with careers.  This is a quick, compelling read without much of a plot.  The beauty of the novel lies rather in the crisp, fresh writing.  This evocative novel has a certain timelessness to it that makes it a wonderful read.  Enjoy.	2003-07-09

Set in the fictional upstate New York town of Gabriel (which sounds an awful lot like Ithaca), the novel follows twenty-something Alex Bernier a reporter for a local paper as she deals with the apparent suicide of her boyfriend, another reporter.  As she digs into the details surrounding his death, she becomes convinced that it was murder.  The story is compelling and holds together very well.  The dialogue, the characters, Alex's interior monologue, the ending, it all works and it all works well.  Enjoy.	2003-07-09

Maneater concerns selfish socialite Clarissa Alpert who at 28 (31) decides it's time to settle down and she has just the man to chase.  She has some close friends who she can at times tolerate, wacky parents and a flashy jet setting life style.  Grazer's novel will make you laugh, make you snicker, make you smile.  It's not great literature, not a deep read, but so what.  It's funny.  I have read through so many chick lit novels that pretend to be funny when they really aren't.  It is a pleasure to find one that actually is.   Enjoy.	2003-07-09

The story, while not exotic or outlandish, still has a crisp, new, fresh feel to it.  The novel concerns, mainly, Edith, a young Australian woman who is 17 in the late 30s.  Her British cousin Leopold and his Armenian friend Aram, visit Edith's family farm for an extended stay.  Aram and Leopold's travel stories spark Edith's imagination and after they leave, she decides, for various reasons, to follow them and seek them out in their home lands.  Despite the war raging on around her, Edith manages to leave Australia and makes it to Armenia.  Edith's life is interesting, her story, engaging.  Ms. London writes extremely well and has given us a superb, engaging and compelling novel.  Enjoy.	2003-07-06

Man and Boy is really a sweet and almost sentimental look at one man's relationship with his son and his own father after his wife leaves him.  Harry Silver is at first not the most likeable protagonist.  He cheats on his wife and then is baffled when she decides to leave him.  Harry's experience as a single parent changes him, and for the better, and as he changes, the novel actually improves.  While it may not make you laugh out loud, it will make you cry real tears (if you are that sort).  The characters, aside from Harry, don't always behave in a believable way, but other than that, this is an enjoyable, quick read.	2003-07-06

Someone I really respect recommended My Year of Meats as one of her favorite novels and I really looked forward to reading it.  What started out strong was ultimately weakened by the overdone preachiness of the novel that just frankly does not work.  The novel begins with a promising premise. A young Japanese-American woman is hired by a Japanese company to produce a television series entitled &quot;My American Wife&quot;--which is to feature a new American woman each week, showcasing her favorite red meat recipe, preferably beef.  What begins as a wacky amusing premise wears thin as Ozeki turns the novel into an expose of the meat industry and its dangerous use of steroids and other additives in meats.  Characters are reduced to plot devices and there are pages and pages where Ozeki just goes on about various evils in the industry.  That just doesn't do it for me in a work of fiction.  If you want to learn about the evils of meat in America--read Fast Food Nation.  Ozeki is clearly a talented writer and I intend to read her next novel--but I cannot really recommend this one.	2003-06-25

There are some wonderful novels that don't have much of a plot in there and Featherstone is one of them.  If you like plot-filled novels, perhaps this one is not for you.  If, however, you derive pleasure from pure, wonderful writing, give Featherstone a try.  The novel opens as Sonny, an elderly gentleman from the town of Featherstone, is out gardening and believes he sees his niece Francie before him for a brief moment.  Francie left town years ago, in search of greener pastures, more exciting times. Over the course of the weekend, the rumor of Francie spreads through the town and ultimately has an effect on people who never knew her.  The writing here is just beautiful.  There is a passage where Gunn describes the town as daybreak hits that is one of the better pieces of evocative writing I've read in a while.  Featherstone is an enjoyable novel, a little short on plotting, but quite strong on writing.  Enjoy.	2003-06-25

Gwen Davis is a lonely woman in the early days of World War II in London when she volunteers to lead a group of women in a war-effort farming experiment on an abadoned estate in the British countryside.  She is devastated to leave London, devastated by the war and yet her experiences away from London turn out to be the most rewarding of her life.  She finally forms a meaningful friendship and begins to fall in love with one of the Canadian soldiers briefly stationed at the estate.  Gwen reflects on the nature of love and happiness, both in her life and in the lives of those around her.  This is an excellent, if short, rewarding novel.  Enjoy.	2003-06-25

I fall into the latter category and I must say, The Second Summer was a fun, delightful novel that I read in one sitting.  You should probably read The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants first because the stories from that novel continue on in this one.  A note to parents--this novel is fairly clean--so if the younger crowd is interested, you should feel comfortable with them reading it.  The novel focuses on mother (or mother-figure)-daughter relationships--the secrets mothers keep from the daughters and vice versa, the problems in those relationship, etc.  The resolution of all these problems is all positive and believable.  Enjoy this one.	2003-06-15

This is the third installment in the Harry Bosch chronicles and is a court room drama and police procedural rolled into one, complete with terrific dialogue, an excellent plot and expert pacing.  Before this series opened, Harry took out the Dollmaker, a notorious LA serial killer.  Harry is now on trial, in civil court, accused of violating the civil rights of the murderer.  During the trial, evidence surfaces that causes Harry to doubt whether he shot the wrong man--could the Dollmaker still be at large?  Connelly handles this story quite well, weaving the stories of the trial and the criminal investigation seamlessly.  This is a well-done escape.  Enjoy.	2003-06-14

It's not really a novel, but rather a 100 page diatribe of a dying man trying to get his affairs in order before the end.  He is in a bed somewhere, spilling water, bleeding slightly on his notes, his books.  He talks to us about everything from the mundane (the blood) to the deeply philisophical (Plato and many, many others).  I read this one one sitting in about an hour because it's that compelling and enjoyable.  The conversation seamlessly moves from real estate matters to artistic matters.  His commentary will make you chuckle, will make you shake your head in agreement.  This is an interesting work and if you are looking from a step up from your average novel.  Enjoy.	2003-06-12

The novel concerns a series of ritual, shocking murders in Miami and several people involved with trying to stop them.  The story begins, not with a murder, or with a police detective heading to the crime scene, but with a woman watching a young child sleep.  The woman, Jane Doe, is living under an alias with Luz, a young child who is not her daughter.  She has thrown away her former, much more comfortable way of life to escape from a horror we learn about as we read the novel.  The novel also follows Detective Iago Paz, a man of Cuban heritage who ultimately discovers that Jane can help him solve these murders.  This novel is completely engrossing; however, I must warn you that much of the plot concerns a kind of sorcery and witchcraft that some may find completely implausible.  Towards the end of the novel, it started to really bother me, but Gruber ties it up neatly (not too neatly) and  brings the novel back to more solid footing.  All in all, an excellent read.  Enjoy.	2003-06-11

I hadn't really ever heard of her before and after reading this novel, I don't know why.  The Fourth Wall is an excellent crime/whodunit novel with a terrific heroine.  Alex Bernier is a twenty-something reporter in upstate New York with a detective boyfriend and an uncanny knack of attracting trouble in the worst way.  Three dead bodies show up in the novel and only one of them is clearly a murder case--but it just happens to have been dead for about 80 years.  The various story lines are very well entertwined and the resolutions are all plausible and satisfying.  This is an excellent escapism read, very entertaining.  Enjoy.	2003-06-07

The story of the extended Hill family who all, for various reasons return to their vast family home, where Aunt Lily lives alone, was simply a delight to read.  Nothing heavy hear, just a wonderful set of stories about the flaws and follies of these various family members.  The story is well-told and often very amusing.  I found myself laughing out loud in public places--it takes a great book to make me do that.  I know others have problems with the sentences in the novel, but I have to disagree.  Reading, the actual act of reading this novel was a bit like talking with a rather educated chatterbox with a sharp eye and a terrific sense of humor.  The sentences and paragraphs may meander, but they get you where you need to be by a scenic and thoroughly amusing route.  The novel does not have (and frankly does not need) a plot that keeps moving forward.  You are not really going to wonder what will happen next, but I assure you, you won't want to miss what happens.  Enjoy.	2003-06-02

The story revolved around our narrator, Andrea Sachs a young woman fresh out of college who through uncanny (and implausible) luck winds up a dream job as an assistant to the editor of a prestigous fashion magazine.  And, in the tradition of The Nanny Diaries (another undeserving overhyped and utterly meanspirited novel), Andrea proceeds to reveal the seamy underside of this \\"fabulous\\" editor.  She's demanding, she's ridiculous, she's mean.  Surprise, surprise.  There are plenty of these bosses throughout the offices of Manhattan, be they in fashion, publishing, law, you name it those bosses are there.  Weisberger of course exaggerates to get her point across, but it's not really funny, just pathetic.  There is also no plot to this novel.  Young woman gets job, hates boss, wants to quit.  Sorry, but that just doesn't add much.  The only positive thing I can say about this novel is the Weisberger does have talent as a writer, she just needs to get a little more creative in her stories.	2003-05-31

The novel concerns the unexplained deaths of two teenage boys, over thirty years apart. Inspector Banks returns home from a Greek vacation to deal with the discovery of the bones of one of his old classmates who had been missing since the mid-sixties.  The story of this murder is juxtaposed with the story of a young man who has disappeared and is soon discovered dead.  The novel is full of suspense and plenty of red herrings.  It's an enjoyable read, especially at the end.  Frankly at the start I was a little wary.  I've read a couple newly-discovered bones mysteries lately, and wasn't exactly searching for another, but this one keeps getting stronger as it goes along to its satisfying finish.  Enjoy.	2003-05-30

The novel is overall, very good, but does have a few flaws.  First off, before you read it, be prepared, it is a satire and as such makes fun of all of the characters--and not just the midwesterners as some have pointed out here.  All of the New York characters are skewered, some mercilessly.  It works very well as a satire--it's funny, witty and will bring a smile to your face, if not out and out laughter.  The story is also believable.  30 year old Lucinda is sent to Prairie City on assignment from the news program she works for and, because the rent on her apartment has skyrocketed astronomically and she fell in love with Prairie City, she convinces her bosses to let her stay for a year and do some on location features.  The job quickly fades into the background as she settles into life in Prairie City.  She becomes involved with one of the locals--and their relationship soon becomes the focal point of the novel.  This is not &quot;chick lit&quot; in that it's a novel where the heroine dates the bad guy first and winds up with the good guy after hilarious and wacky antics.  There is no fairy tale ending here--this is more of a realistic, satirical take on American people today.  I did find fault with some of the character development--some of them were so flat they did belong in a chick lit novel--however, most had rings of truth to them.  The novel does at times suffer from an identity crisis.  Does it want to be a satirical look at life in America--or is it a more introspective look at one young woman's fictional life?  All in all, though, this novel makes for interesting and entertaining reading.	2003-05-25

It's a great story, very funny.  The action in the novel takes place from July 2001-June 2002 in New Jersey high school student Jessica Darling's life.  She spends part of her summer at writing camp, and then comes home to deal with the trials and tribulations of modern high school life and  her senior year--college selection, boyfriends, mad crushes, friends, enemies.  The novel takes the form of Jessica's diary, so we are privy to her innermost thoughts--many of which concern Marcus--an obsession that has followed her around since we last saw Jessica in Sloppy Firsts.  Jessica is a great narrator--funny, sarcastic, poignant, heartbreaking, and even at times infuriating.  This is a terrific novel and you certainly don't have to read Sloppy Firsts to enjoy it, but read Sloppy Firsts first--it is an excellent novel, just as strong as this one.  I think anyone would enjoy this novel--it certainly does not need to be limited to the young adult crowd.  Enjoy.	2003-05-23

Van Wormer weaves two story lines around Sally Harrington, a thirty year old reporter living in her home town in Connecticut.  Sally is dealing with a mysterious murder in her home town which may or may not have a connection to her father's accidental death some twenty years earlier and a high-paying assignment from a high profile magazine to do a story on a beautiful celebrity.  She is torn between her old boyfriend and a new love she meets during the novel.  The story lines work well together--and both involve events that have Sally questioning her beliefs and assumptions about the people in her life.  I had a minor concern that Van Wormer was somehow going to neatly tie both story lines together in some sort of far fetched plot development, but she does not.  Instead they both resolve naturally, but not independently.  This is a well done romantic thriller and an excellent read.  Enjoy.	2003-05-22

The novel concerns a young, single New York woman who falls in love with a man pretending to be her next door neighbor's nephew.  Not the most original plot in the world, but so what.  The Boy Next Door is a lot of fun to read, very entertaining, lots of fun.  If  you are looking for a light, chick-lit-ish read, this is the perfect candidate.  Enjoy.	2003-05-20

The novel is fun and entertaining in a bubble gum-pop sort of way.  The story concerns six Latina women in their late twenties--all close friends, to a certain extent--and their lives.  It's a fun read, but afterwards, I had some criticism.  The novel takes itself just a bit too seriously than the storyline merits.  All of the characters are smashing career successes (at age 28!), yet all of them are failures in love.  A bit of variation in their situations and perhaps a touch more lightheartedness would have improved the novel.  Dirty Girls is not serious literature by any stretch of the imagination.  What it is is a fun, amusing and entertaining read that is sure to please.  Enjoy.	2003-05-19

The Crimson Petal and the White is such a novel.  The novel concerns assorted prostitutes and those of a more moneyed class in London in the 1870s and focuses on Sugar, a 19-year old, and very intelligent, prostitute and her relationship with her wealthy benefactor, William Rackam.  Faber is able to keep the reader interested and entertained for 800+ pages because the Sugar-Rackam relationship is constantly morphing into something else and because the other characters who inhabit their world are so compelling.  There is William's older brother Henry, who struggles to behave morally in an immoral world, his friend Emmeline, who participates in a rescue society, to 'rescue' prostitutes from their sordid lives, William's anorexic, troubled wife Agnes, William's servants, Sugar's prostitute friends.  All these characters are fabulously human--flawed and able to bring smiles, or tears, to your face at the appropriate moment.  The novel is also thought-provoking in that it highlights the difficult position most women, and not just prostitutes were in at that time, as well as the ridiculousness of the British class system at that time, yet it does so without an ounce of preachiness.  The Crimson Petal and the White is an excellent novel and a terrific read.  If you can handle 800 pages, I highly recommend you pick this one up.	2003-05-16

I have never read any of Mayor's novels before, so I cannot compare them to the rest of the Joe Gunther series, but as a newcomer, I thought this novel was excellent.  Willy Kunkle is a man haunted by a number of ghosts, and at the outset of the novel, he gets a new ghost--his ex-wife, who is found dead of an apparent heroin overdose in New York City.  Kunkle immediately heads to New York from Vermont to identify the body, but is immediately pulled into finding out the true cause of her death.  Things don't add up for Kunkle and he embarks on a one man mission to discover what really happened.  The novel reads like one of the better Law and Order episodes--you won't be able to put it down.

The novel has four different narrators, each with a different version of reality. By the time the novel is over, the reader realizes that probably all of them were lying in their narratives for they certainly were all lying as they lived their lives.  The novel opens with the story of two men on a train during World War I.  One man is headed for the front, the other, for a cushy, safe railroad position.  They play chess with high stakes.  If the soldier wins, he claims the identity of the railway employee, if he loses, he kills himself.  The name of the soldier, Thadeus Dreyer, changes hands several times in the novel.  The man who is Dreyer ultimately organizes the Amphitryon Project during World War II, where doubles for high ranking nazis stand in for them at certain public events.  The novel is intriguing and labarynth-like, and will have you questioning every word of each narrator in your search for \\"truth\\".  An excellent read.	2003-05-12

He meets a woman on this later train, and has an affair with her.  In what may be seen as a thinly veiled homage to marital fidelity, our heroes life quickly spirals into hell as he attempts to consumate this affair.  Murder, bribery, embezzlement, the list of evils he must face go on and on.  While reading the book, I thougth I figured out where Siegel was headed--I was both right and wrong.  I don't want to give away anything, but suffice it to say, the plot took interesting, unexpected and intriguing (yet still plausible) turns.  Derailed is a clever, engaging story.  You really won't be able to put it down.  Enjoy.	2003-05-06

It is the story of Stacey Temple, a thirty-something singleton who works at thongs.com (you know the novel can't be too serious with a job like that).  Stacey figures out that she has gone almost an entire year without sex (and barely noticed!).  She becomes obsessed with avoiding becoming an \\"accidental virgin\\"--or someone who has gone without for 365 days.  She's got a week left and a couple promising candidates, but nothing seems to go right for poor Stacey.  This is a funny and very fluffy novel.

For starters, the opening chapter has the heroine, Tansy, waking up in a hospital bed after having her stomach pumped on the day of her alcoholic mother's funeral.  The rest of the novel is like that, a bit more gritty and real than your standard romantic comedy.  Tansy's life in London, including her relationship with her boyfriend, begins to come apart and to escape it all, she travels to Asia, where she initially rejects the term \\"backpacker\\" although, that is what she is.  Her experiences are very evocative of traveling, as a twenty-somthing, in a third world nation.  The novel is funny and adds a bit of suspense with a murder mystery subplot that wasn't entirely necessary.  Tansy--who began the novel as an annoying, coke addicted witch--grows up in a believable way as the novel progresses.  Backpack makes for fun, breezy, enjoyable reading.	2003-04-29

Pelecanos does not shy away from disturbing story lines and this novel is no exception. Strange and his partner Terry Quinn are caught, as they always are, in the middle of violence and drug dealing turf wars in Washington.  The cast of characters is not pretty, nor is the action.  You've got drug dealers, gun dealers, murderers, gang wars, etc.  While the stories are disturbing, they are also entertaining.  The background of the novel is filled with Pelecanos trademark soundtrack.  The novel makes for a quick, gripping read.  The one caveat I would give you is that Pelecanos gets a little preachy, through the characters, regarding gun control and the death penalty, but I do think his is an honest exploration of the ramifications of both of those hot potatoes.  Enjoy.	2003-04-25

For Caroline Dunlap, a recent college graduate returning home for the summer, the summer, the hazards include divorced parents, a mother who has lost much of her grip on reality, a father who can't connect with his children, a younger brother who is a bit of a social misfit, an ex-boyfriend babbling on and on about living in Tibet, boring parties and even more boring people.  Much of the action in the novel is seen through Caroline's eyes and luckily for the reader, Caroline sees through most of the garbage in the wealthy world she grew up in.  The novel makes for entertaining reading and is very reminiscent of Cheever and O'Hara, but is told with more of an obviously discerning eye.  Enjoy.	2003-04-24

Carmen, one of the friends, owns these used blue jeans--the magical pants.  Each one of the four friends looks fabulous in the pants--they decide to share the pants over the summer as a reminder of their friendship and head their separate ways.  Carmen goes off to spend the summer with her father, only to discover he is engaged to a woman with a family of her own.  Tibby stays home and works at a local store and befriends a younger girl with cancer.  Bridget goes to Baja for soccer camp and falls for an older soccer coach.  Finally, Lena travels to Greece with her sister to spend the summer with her grandparents.  They mail the pants back and forth, but the story isn't really about the pants, it is about a strong friendhip among these four young women.  It's an enjoyable, fairly squeaky clean story that I think anyone who has been fifteen, or looks forward to being fifteen, will enjoy.	2003-04-22

Elvis Cole is watching his girl friend's son Ben while she is away travelling when Ben mysteriously disappears.  Has he been kidnapped, or has he merely run away?  Do the kidnappers have anything to do with Elvis' past, or is it something else?  These are some of the questions Elvis and co. struggle with while trying to find Ben.

Christopher Buckley tears apart lawyers, the media (and particularly, lawyers who manipulate the media), politicians, you name it, he's ridiculing it.  It's a funny novel that avoids any ounce of meanspiritedness.  The novel concerns the events that follow the sudden death of the president.  His wife is accused of murder and she turns to her ex-fiance who just so happens to be among the top trial lawyers and publicity seekers in the country.  What follows is a media circus of a trial--ridiculousness that you could almost see happening (but hopefully never will).  This is a funny, almost silly novel that does not take itself, nor its subjects, too seriously, which, in this instance, is a good thing.  Enjoy.	2003-04-20

Logan is not the nicest person in the world.  He manipulates friends for his own amusement, sleeps with one of his closests friend's fiance, and commits a number of other, minor atrocities.  Yet for all Logan's badness, I missed him when I finished the novel and throughout, I found myself rooting for his finding some semblance of happiness.  Logan is entirely human in the sense that his story indeed could be the story of any human heart--any British heart is probably more like it.  He manages to come in contact with quite a few notables from the twentieth century and reinvents himself and his career many times over.  Perhaps no one lives a life as rich as Logan, maybe so.  But that still does not take away from the fact that Any Human Heart is a terrific novel, excellent storytelling.  Enjoy.	2003-04-18

The novel concerns Lily Owen a young teenage girl in a Southern town in 1964.  Her mother died years ago under circumstances Lily barely remembers and her father is somewhat lacking in empathetic parenting skills.  Lily and her black babysitter, Rosaleen, escape from their small town in search of the truth behind Lily's mother's life.  They wind up in Tiburon, South Carolina, living with three black sisters who keep bees where Lily ultimately learns the truth about her mother.  The novel is reminiscent, somewhat, of To Kill a Mockingbird, The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood, among others.  There are no surprises here, nothing that makes it stand out.

She befriends Tulip, the eunuch who serves as the novel's narrator, and ultimately works her way up in the seraglio over the course of many years.  The story of the novel is an interesting, easy read.  The choice of Tulip as the narrator is a curious one.  In certain parts of the novel, he essentially must spy on Aimee to get events into the narrative, which can be clunky.  The natural narrator for the novel would have been Aimee--but for whatever reason, Wallach chose Tulip.  All in all, this is a nice, interesting, easy read.  Enjoy.	2003-04-15

Coyote is a moon of a planet in a solar system many light-years from Earth.  The action in the novel takes place well in the future, when the world has drastically changed.  The U.S. is no longer, and what is in its place is particularly unappealing.

It is, but it isn't.  It is a well-written historically-based murder mystery with a clever premise, written by an obviously brilliant Dante scholar.  But the novel is lacking a certain something to make it really great.  It doesn't ever come together--I found nothing to make me care about what happened, nothing compelling me to keep reading.  I see from other reviews that many others absolutely loved this novel and I am sure that many reading this review will agree with them.

To deal with their grief, or maybe to run away from it, Hand and Will haphazardly plan a trip around the world in one week to give away $80,000 Will has acquired almost by accident.  The novel concerns both this trip and Will's story of his friendship with Jack.  Their travels never go as intended (because they never, ever make any plans).  Will's reflections on Jack's death are devastatingly evocative.  Eggers is an excellent writer and the novel is, for the most part, a heartbreaking work of staggering genius.

At the heart of the novel is Ray Mitchell, a man returning home to the fictional New Jersey town of Dempsey.  He has had some successes and comes home for various reasons-some admirable, some not.  He volunteers to teach a creative writing class at his old high school, and the next thing we know, he is in the hospital after being brutally beaten in his apartment.  The novel moves back and forth in time (although all in the space of a few months), shifting perspective between Ray and Nerese Ammons the determined detective investigating the beating.  She suspects he knows who beat him, and has various plausible theories.  The resolution of the novel is unexpected, but certainly not unbelievable.  The characters are terrific, as is the dialogue.

She hires on two untouchable tailors, Om and Ishvar, nephew and uncle, to continue with her work and takes in a boarder, Maneck, a college student and son of an old friend.  After many mistakes and miscues, the four form a bond stronger than any familial bond they may have ever experienced.  The circumstances and lives of these four characters are fascinating, illuminating and at times, depressing.  Mistry's novel is superb and well-written and manages itself to keep a fine balance between pathos and humor for an excellent reading experience.  Enjoy.	2003-03-04

Byatt.  A Whistling Woman is a terrific novel, in my opinion almost as good as her phenomenal Possession.  The story of Frederica Potter comes to a close (at least for us readers) at the end of the novel, and what a story it is--not for plotting reasons, but for how it is told.  A Whistling Woman is an intelligently written, thoughtful and thought provoking novel of ideas focusing on one woman, Frederica, and a number of others who touch her life.  Byatt shifts back and forth between plot lines and characters in a manner similar to Iris Murdoch.  Like Murdoch, Byatt draws heavily from philisophical learning.  All of the characters are highly intelligent and not afraid to show it.  This is a wonderful, wonderful novel--one of the best I have read in quite some time.  Enjoy!	2003-03-03

It is, however, one terrific novel, full of brilliant, inspired (by pop culture) prose that will wow you if you are ready for it.  There is no plot in the novel, per se, but rather a story that keeps recurring in an almost dream-like fashion in the ramblings of the various characters who mirror those of the Gilligan's Island sit com.  Gilligan's Wake is a weird, experimental novel and if that's not for you, well, try another novel.  But, if that is for you, pick this one up--it's great.	2003-03-03

The novel lacked enough focus to make it truly enjoyable, and thus winds up all over the map.  As an example, the first chapter of the novel deals with Fidelis, the master butcher of the title, how he gets to America, etc.  Then we meet two other characters in the next chapter Delphine and her partner Cyprian and at a certain point the charcters meet, but Fidelis is never developed as a character and Delphine and Cyprian's antics just didn't seem to fit with what was happening with Fidelis.  I am not saying a novel has to be perfect and tightly packaged with everything fitting together--I just think that this particular novel lacks a certain cohesiveness that would have made it a much more enjoyable read.	2003-02-24

Katherine Mosby is a terrific writer and so what if her characters speak more eloquently than most people.  We would if we could.  The story concerns Gabriel Gibbs, who has been kicked out of boarding school and must spend a few months with Spencer his older brother.  During their time together, Gabriel befriends Lillian Dawes, a fascinating older woman with on whom he has a very strong crush.  Lillian ultimately becomes involved with Spencer.  The story is a combination of The Great Gatsby and The Catcher in the Rye--it is the coming of age of a wealthy cynic.  The ending is fabulous.  Mosby leaves enough to the imagination to make it incredibly satisfying without being too perfect or tied up.  Enjoy.	2003-02-21

Isabelle is a photographer who desperately desires to be taken seriously as an artist and her husband Eldon is a cartographer who faces similar dilemmas.  Annie's intelligence and beauty endear her to the couple, for varying reasons.  She ultimately becomes a subject for Isabelle's photos and almost a friend to Isabelle.

Cahill backs it up with facts and you really cannot argue with him.  He also fills the book with many interesting facts which convinced at least me (a person of Irish descent) that the Irish really had it together.

The plot was a bit contrived (which is OK in these types of novels, you expect it), but coupled with unimaginative characters behaving in unrealistic ways--it's just an OK read.  I was surprised because I have read a few of Kelly Ripa's other picks and while none of them are War and Peace, there is usually something about them that distinguishes them from the pack.  I would say, don't go out of your way to find this book, but if it finds its way to you (like when you are stuck on a long plane ride) it won't do you any harm.	2003-02-20

The story concerns a middle-aged school teacher, Ramchandra, living in Katmandu.  He has a wife he loves, two children and annoying in-laws who don't seem to like him that much.  Ramchandra has middle class dreams of owning a house, but his realities keep him from that dream.  To pick up some extra money, he tutors on the side.  One of his tutees, Malati, is a young single mother with whom Ramchandra beomes a bit obsessed with.  He begins an affair with her and ultimately, his wife finds out.  His wife's behavior, while a little unconventional, makes for interesting reading.  Ramchandra is not the most sympathetic of protagonists, but he is all to human and most readers will see bits of themselves in him, if not in his actions.  The final resolutions of various parts of the novel (why Ramchandra's wife married him in the first place, what happens to Malati) are particularly satisfying.  Not neat, tidy endings, but an excellent, and a bit amusing, ending.  Enjoy this well-written novel.	2003-02-13

Kathryn Davis takes an essentially fictional look at her life and gets into her brain.  What we get is an essentially stream of consciousness meditation of Marie Antoinette looking back on her life, with little regrets.  Davis writes beautifully--the words seem to glide off the pages effortlessly.  Marie Antoinette is not a wholly likeable narrator, but she is certainly human and certainly not a monster.  Versailles is an interesting exploration of not history, but a historical figure.	2003-02-11

It is a fictional account of an actual murder suspect from Great Britain in the early 70s.  Lord Lucan was accused of murdering his children's nanny and the attempted murder of his wife, but escaped capture.  Although there are those that suspect he then killed himself, there are others who believe he has been living in some form of exile, with the help of many of his wealthy friends, the aiders and abettors the novel's title refers to.  In this novel, we meet two \\"Lord Lucans\\", both seeking treatment in the present day from Dr. Hildegard Wolf, a psychiatrist practicing in France.  She too is escaping some deceptions of her past (although they are no where near as heinous as murder).  She initally believes they are both frauds, but things begin to change her mind.  The novel also follows the paths of two people who believe they are closing in on Lord Lucan.  But are they?  This is an intriguing novella that tells an interesting story.  Spark's writing is fabulous, as usual.  Enjoy.	2003-02-11

It could never in a million years happen in reality, but that doesn't detract from its beauty.  Roxane Coss, a talented American soprano, is lured down to a nameless South American country to sing for at the birthday party of a visiting Japanese businessman.  The party, with some 200 attendees, is invaded by a group of terrorists seeking to kidnap the president of this nameless country.  He's not there, they won't leave, stalemate ensues.  While some prisoners leave, a group of 50 remain, including the soprano and the businessman.  The situation goes on for months and during those months, many of the young terrorists become involved with their captives, the music Ms. Coss sings somehow subtly changes things.  Art triumphs over terror.  Yes, it is very far-fetched, but it still makes for entertaining reading.	2003-02-06

What I can say is that as a stand alone novel, Jolie Blon's Bounce is very good.  It's a dark, murky, evocative crime novel with a protagonist who sports many personality flaws, but who is still endearing in a hard-boiled way.  The brutal murders of two young women in New Orleans bring back some brutal,haunting memories for Dave Robicheaux.  Dave does not believe the prime suspect is guilty and must dig deep to find the truth.  This novel is very well-written.  I can see why Burke is so popular.  Enjoy.	2003-02-06

Pierre manages to track her down in Nebraska.  For some reason, after their bus breaks down, Pierre and Natalie decide to stay in Seldom, Nebraska, a town full of &quot;wacky&quot; (and misunderstood) characters.  What was at first very amusing and funny begins to wear thin as Hansen develops his characters and they start behaving straight out of your standard contemporary romance novel.  The whole wonderful toungue-in-cheekiness of the novel starts to vanish and we are left with something more tiring.	2003-02-04

George held firmly to the belief that appearances are everything, that one need not dig deeply to discover the true nature of one's friends and acquaitances, of events and occurences.  George, in recounting his story years later, admits, in so many words, that he was dead wrong.  Geoge's story is an amusing, engaging, complicated tale.  The London he inhabits, with it's ridiculous wig and dress codes, is quite entertaining .  He befriends Lady Beauclair, a woman who regales him with the story of Tristano, a man whose fortunes ultimately become entangled with George's.  George, in recounting his story, certainly weaves a tangled web, but it is a fun web to unravel.  Enjoy.	2003-02-03

At the heart of the novel is Rommy Gandolph, a semi-literate man condemned to death for a murder committed 10 years earlier.  Although Rommy signed a confession, he now claims he is innocent.  Arthur Raven, a lonely, brilliant, 37 year old lawyer has been appointed as his counsel.  Raven has troubles of his own, all of them personal, not judicial.  He has never been able to have a meaningful relationship with a woman and must care for his schizophrenic sister.  Arthur is at first highly suspicious of Rommy's claims, but after a while becomes convinced based on certain new evidence.  Turow works this evidence well--he will keep you guessing throughout most of the novel whether or not Rommy is indeed guilty of the murders.  This is a terrific novel that will make you think about the nature of forgiveness in contemporary America--as well as the concept of capital punishment.  Reversible Errors is an engaging, thought-provoking work.  Enjoy!	2003-01-31

I enjoyed it and, well, I must admit, it has been quite some time since I fit into that category.  Jessica, the heroine and narrator, is devasted by her best friend's moving out of town, and must now contend with friends she doesn't think she likes and the unwanted advances of a high school jock, among other things.  The novel covers her life in 2000 quite well--we follow her ups and downs which develop in an unpredictable way.  Her parents drive her crazy, as do her hormones.  I think all &quot;young adults&quot; would enjoy this novel, as would any one else who enjoys romantic comedies, or just good reads in general.  The novel is refreshingly original, funny and endearing.  I for one am looking forward to the next installment of Jessica's life.	2003-01-30

Josie Flynn leaves her native London and her pining, cheating exhusband for a brief trip to New York to be the maid of honor in her cousin's wedding.  While on the plane, she meets Matt, a charming English man, and they hit it off immediately.  Sometime after Jo arrives in NYC, the novel starting losing most of its appeal.  All the characters began behaving rather idiotically and the whole thing became annoying.  I realize you must suspend your disbelief with a romantic comedy, but most of the occurences were a little too much, for various reasons, for this to be an enjoyable novel.	2003-01-27

It is also the story of the candy striper, the baby's father, his next door neighbor, and the two local caterers planning the Christmas party, among others.  What the novel lacks in cohesiveness it makes up for in amusement and terrific writing.  There is one part of the novel in which Ash praises Free Bird (the song) while grousing about the current state of popular music which is among the most brilliant passages I have ever read.  So funny and so absolutely on target that it almost hurts.  If you can get past the fact that this novel is all over the place and its focus is a little blurry, you will enjoy it immensely.

Cal retraces the story of her family back to her grandparents and how certain incestuous relationships led to a genetic mutation which caused him (and it is him narrating from the present) to be born genetically ambiguous.  Although raised as a girl, Cal's life as a young teen, particularly with respect to her sexual awakening, is confusing at best.  Ultimately, the truth is discovered and Cal figures out how he wants to live his life and what fun it is to discover it along with him.  This story is great--funny, full of great characters, scintillating dialog and brilliant prose.  I will say that it starts off a bit slowly, but then takes off, you won't be able to put it down.

Bob and Mary Rove were the perfect couple, everyone loved them.  Even when their second son Christopher is born with serious disabilities, Bob and Mary were a terrific couple.  Bob was incredibly supportive of Christopher and worked hard to help him develop.  Somewhere along the way, though, something in Bob snapped.  He sought help, but found none and wound up murdering his family with a baseball bat.  He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and ultimately was given another chance to find happiness.  Did he deserve it?  Was the insanity defense proper in his case?  Should someone else have seen this coming?  Should he had been able to continue to practice law?  Those and other moral questions will certainly run through your mind as you read this work.  For the most part, Facing the Wind is a gripping and engaging work.  My only complaint is that Salamon spends much more time than necessary focussing on a support group that Bob and Mary belonged to.  She details the lives of the members of the group and the problems they encountered with their children.  I realize that the group was the way Salamon connected with the story in the first place, but the sections concerning the support group could have used a little editing.  Despite that one drawback, this is an interesting and thought-provoking work.	2003-01-23

Whereas his other novels are rather heavy, Baudolino has such a light touch, but thankfully is not \\"light\\" reading by any stretch of the imagination.  The year is 1204 and Constantinople is under siege.  Baudolino rescues Niketas, a historian and over the course of several days, recounts the story of his life, freely admitting at the outset that he is a liar and has told lies all his life.  The story he recounts is outrageous--exposing the relic market in the middle ages, the death of Frederick Barbarossa (Baudolino's adoptive father), the Holy Grail among other things.  It begins when Baudolino is about 12 and has an encounter with Frederick, who is so taken with him that he adopts him (although both parents were still living).  Baudolino goes to Paris to study and befriends the first of an amazing, amusing cast of characters that will accompany him on his journeys throughtout the novel.  They seek the Holy Grail, Prester John, unicorns, all sorts of fancy.  The novel is simply delightful, told with a light wit that at times reminded me of  Monty Python (probably simply because of the whole Holy Grail thing).  The novel is clever as well, because while it will make you smile, make you chuckle, it will also lead you to ponder about the nature of fiction versus truth in various capacities.  Eco is incredibly talented; none of his novels are really like the others, but all are wonderful.  This one is terrific.	2003-01-17

We see bits and pieces of Cohn, and he ultimately comes to the family's rescue, but this novel is certainly not what you would expect.  It is not about Roy Cohn or any of his activities.  It is about an American family and how they survive the near fatal illness of one of their children coupled with the imprisonment of the father.  That's what is sort of odd about it.  It's take is refreshingly unexpected and the writing is very strong.  Overall, an interesting and different read.	2003-01-14

Zadie Smith herself is an incredibly talented writer.  Autograph Man, while good, pales in comparison to White Teeth, and yet, because of her talent Autograph Man is still pretty good.  The story of Alex-Li Tandem and his quest for the autograph of an reclusive 50s movie star lacks a certain cohesiveness to make it all hang together and work.  You cannot say anything bad about each individual paragraph or sentence in the novel--it's just that, taken as a whole, there is something missing.  Still, it makes for good fun reading.	2003-01-14

Her According to Queeney is a witty and wonderful masterpiece and reveals a side of Samuel Johnson little seen.  The focus of the novel is his friendship with the Thrale family, in particular, Hester, the wife and mother.  The Queeney of the title is Hester's eldest, and very precocious, daughter.  In the novel, Johnson is portrayed as brilliant, but difficult--moody, depressed, obsessed, the list goes on.  Bainbridge's novel is witty--full of sparkling dialogue and wonderful prose.

Pelecanos' story shifts from the Washington DC gang members to the corrupt cops to honest people just trying to get by and back again.  It's not really about one crime, like a murder that must be solved.  Rather it concerns a chain reaction of events which occur after a bag of drug money is taken from a flaming car.  The characters are real and will stay with you after you put the novel down.  The resolution is satisfying--nothing canned or predictible here.  The Sweet Forever is an enjoyable, engrossing read.	2003-01-14

There is something wonderful, entrancing about the rhythm of her prose that is again present in I'll Take You There.  Her writing is always so wonderfully evocative and almost hypnotic.  Her characters, in particular the nameless narrator if I'll Take You There, are all trapped in something they cannot see, but which Oates lets us see all too well.  In I'll Take You There, the narrator, a young college woman in the early 60s is desperately trying to fit it and although at times she succeeds, that success is only external.  Internally, for some reason she perceives herself as a loser, a misfit.  She tries first to fit in with a sorority and when that doesn't work out, she undertakes a relationship with a African American graduate student about ten years her senior.  Neither of these \\"relationships\\" are right for the narrator for reasons she sees, but for some reason ignores.  She is a complex and at times frustrating protagonist, yet Oates keeps you reading.  I enjoyed this book very much, but I will say that if you are not an Oates fan, this novel will not change your mind.  Oates fans, on the other hand, should enjoy this one completely.	2003-01-09

It is clearly one of her best, if not her best, novel.  The story of this dysfunctional Baltimore family is very well done, well-written, well-paced, with a perfect blend of humor and pathos.  Pearl is in her thirties with three young children when her husband walks out on her.  She does not have it easy, but she tries her best, which unfortunately does not get her family all the way to Norman Rockwell.  The children all have their issues.  One brother is ridiculously jealous of another, to the extent that her ruins what may have been his brother's only chance at happiness.  Pearl's daughter leads an unsettled life which is somewhat reminiscent of the life of the protagonist in Tyler's more recent Back When We Were Grownups.  There is a lot in here, a lot going on, but Tyler always manages to get to the point, so there is no time wasted reading endless paragraphs going nowhere.  This novel is very well done and the perfect place to start if you have never read her before.	2003-01-07

Gabe is an LA teenager with a mother desperately trying to protect him from the quasi-violent life of Tomas, his older brother, as well as keeping him from the violent, hot, humid life in the Phillipines she left so long ago.  Gabe's American father, another source of violence, left them years earlier, but his absence still scars all of them.  Gabe is the &quot;good&quot; son while Tomas breeds violent dogs for paranoid Los Angelinos and sports scary tattoos, clothes, cars and haircuts.  Gabe decides to escape it all, to run away, but his running away has more dire consequences for him.  All the while his mother, whom he loves, but for whom he feels a certain amount of shame, tries to ignore other family members who insist that both boys should return to the Phillipines.  American Son is a dark novel, filled with violence without being violent itself, never depressing, only upsetting.  Gabe's struggle with who he is, coupled with life in moder LA makes for interesting reading.	2003-01-07

He wants to get out of the whole political realm, but they keep pulling him back.  When one of his closest friends and political allies dies under somewhat suspicious circumstances, Roscoe steps in to prevent further troubles to the friend's family when a custody battle ensues.  The plot has some interesting twists and fun-to-read-about characters.  The dialog is good, almost too good.  I can't imagine that people would actually talk like that, but it is a delight to read.  For some reason, while reading this novel, I kept seeing the characters from The Road to Perdition.  The 1930s mob and the 1940s Albany political machine have many similarities, according to Kennedy at least.  Roscoe is a very well-written novel by a talented novelist--perhaps not his strongest, but still quite good.	2003-01-06

I have enjoyed all of her novels, for the most part, although I have found that they all, save Blessings, contain a certain amount of annoying self-righteousness.  Blessings, perhaps because of its subject matter is refreshingly free of that element.  It is a pleasant, easy read--the story of a newborn baby left on the steps of the wealthiest home in a small town and how that baby changed the lives of the people she touched.  The characters, while hiding a few surprises, behave reasonably.  The dialogue is well-written.  It's just a nice read.  Enjoy.	2003-01-06

About halfway though the novel, I started to get nervous as to how Grimwood would resolve the novel.

The dumping is so spectacular that it catches the national imagination--Marcie becomes an instant celebrity a la Darva Conger and others like her.  People Magazine and their ilk come running, pursuing her at every turn.  This is an amusing novel and because of it's unique story line (as compared to your standard romantic comedy), it is not absolutely predictable.

A good friend of mine who is also a teacher recommended this book to me and it has proven to be an excellent resource.  It gives, in very basic terms, the range of abilities for each year (ages 4-14), as well as suggesting classroom activities for teachers.  This is an excellent resourse, which, while not exhaustive by any means, should be an excellent first step in working with your child through the years and speaking with teachers.

Reading this novel is like spending time with an old friend with a rapier sharp sarcastic wit.  In terms of plotting here, not much happens, but for a novel of about 250 pages, that is OK.  Fleming Ford, the narrator, is a 40-year old Southerner living in Esperanza California who becomes a bit obsessed with an older widower she knows from New York.  Her out-of-place-ness enables her to observe all around her with a deadpan aloofness that is always funny and at times hilarious.

The first tells the story of the nameless narrator and Dostoyevsky admirer as he retraces the steps Dostoyevsky and his new wife took in the 1860s--the second story.  The narrator's admiration for Dostoyevsky is not strong enough to enable him to conceal the underside of Dostoyevsky's personality--the obsessive gambling, the cruelty to his wife, the anti-Semitism.  The narration itself is beautful--the light, almost humorous tone is wonderful and manages to carry off multi-page paragraphs without losing the reader.  This is a rich little treasure.

For some reason, I believed her &quot;secret&quot; was a life she led before she met her husband and settled down, but that's not it.  Her secret, her sin, is her wanderlust that caused her to escape an earlier marriage with no other excuse than boredom.  She then lived in a commune of sorts, in the late sixties with a group of other young people.  For reasons I won't divulge, that life ends and she ultimately establishes her career as a vet, marries a wonderful, even in her opinion, man and has three daughters.  When one of the other commune members pops back, unexpectedly, into her life, she is tempted again by that wanderlust.  Jo is a flawed and very much believable character.  I found myself getting mad at her for some of her behavior, yet I could still understand why she did what she did.  This novel would make an excellent basis for a reading group discussion because nothing in the novel is all that unbelievable and for the most part the choices Jo is faced with, or thought she was faced with could happen to any of us, but not all would follow her path.  While I Was Gone is a very well done novel, well told and engaging.  Much food for thought and discussion.	2002-12-20

Vincent Passaro is such a talented writer that he doesn't have to do that.  He, instead, tells it like it is in such a wonderful refreshing way that pyrotechnics and silly plot twists are rendered unnecessary.  Violence, Nudity, Adult Content concerns Will Riordan, a senior associate gunning for partner in a New York law firm.  He's got two unusual cases dogging him, and his marriage is falling apart.  His job is a bit unfulfilling, the intra-firm politics vex him and in one of these cases, he must defend a wealthy client everyone believes murdered his wife.  Will struggles with the morality of it all, including his rather high salary on which he has difficulty scraping by, in a wonderfully cynical manner.

He's just not the best narrator to spend over 400 pages with.

Their adventures take a tragic turn when Gemma dies under quite mysterious circumstances.  Esther blames herself for losing her friend.  After Gemma's death, the novel jumps forward several years.  Esther is still coping with what happened when a series of freakish coincidences lead her to the understand the truth of what happened in India and what happened to her friendship with Gemma, how she really \\"lost\\" her friend.  The coincidences are a bit clunky and the author uses some unconvincing devices to get into Gemma's head in the middle of what otherwise would be a first person narrative, but other than that, I thought this novel was quite well done.  The writing is excellent and it does make you think about the many ways you can lose a friend.	2002-12-03

The week is bittersweet because the house is being sold.  The father/grandfather has recently died and his wife decides the house is more than she can handle.  This novel explores the little things, the details of the life of this family, yet still manages, in an almost sneaky way, to cover the larger issues as well.  This is a rather long (over 500 pages) novel, yet I found it to be a quick read because it was so enjoyable, so evocative.  The novel brings you into that vacation week, into the minor family dramas very effectively.  Enjoy.	2002-11-23

On the flip side, I think that this book will have much appeal to non-sci fi fans.  Peter Kropotkin, a Russian anarchist who died in the early 20th century is offered the chance, on his deathbed, to be reborn, as a 30ish man, in 1999.  Kropotkin is a bright man and an utterly charming narrator.  His story is interesting and engaging and fairly plausible.  My only complaint is that the ending is not as strong as the rest of the novel, almost as if Danvers didn't really know quite how to end the novel.  Still, this is an excellent, fun read.	2002-11-23

Kay and Benjamin, these former lovers both rehash their relationship, and others, in their minds while in bed together.  This novella really is not about the sex, it's about the relationship, why it failed, whose fault it was.  This one is brief, but I still find myself thinking about the characters, who they remind me of, who was the more deplorable.  Rapture is an interesting exploration of current sexual mores and relationships.	2002-11-23

There is a narrator, but we never discover his name.  He's not really that important--rather he recounts the story of Jacques Austerlitz as he recounted it to our narrator.  Austerlitz himself does not fully know his own story, first-hand, but rather must discover truths about himself, his family, his heritage, even his own name, during the course of his life.  As long as he could remember, until he was 15 he believed he was Welsh--but then discovers that he had emigrated to Wales in 1939, to be cared for by a childless Welsh couple he thought were his parents.  He returns to Eastern Europe to discover his true heritage, and there is assaulted by the ruins of memory--both his and those who knew him.  Austerlitz is a fascinating novel, with an interesting structure and approach.  The story you read is somehow not the story--you must sift through the elements to get to the heart of the truth.  An excellent, well-done, moving novel.	2002-11-20

This is still a wonderful alternative history.  Covering a thousand years of such alternative history is certainly ambitious and for the most part, this novel works.  We follow a few souls (who conveniently always have names beginning with the same letter) through this alternative history, which begins with all of Europe wiped out by the plague.  The souls are reborn and many times make the same mistakes from prior lives.  Robinson certainly has his opinions on what works in our current civilization and extrapolates these ideas into his alternative history. This is an interesting, imaginative book that I found to be quite pleasurable to read.  It can be a lot of fun if you don't take it too seriously.	2002-11-19

Haven Kimmel recounts her childhood in a small town in Indiana during the 60s and 70s.  The memoir is told with innocence, without a hint of irony and is nothing if not charming.  Zippy is a typical child of suburban America and this memoir is very evocative of those times.  This is an enjoyable read.	2002-11-17

The novel takes place in a dying industrial town in the mid-west.  The narrator, Bill is in his early twenties, wealthy in the sense that his ancestors in the town left him with a mansion, and writes for the local newspaper.  Bill makes most cynics look like Pollyanna, yet is an engaging narrator, telling a compelling story.  Old man Lawton is reported missing by his son Ronny.  Murder is suspected and Ronny is the main suspect.  Bill becomes obsessed with Lawton's disappearance, becoming involved with those he suspects may be involved in the murder, Ronny, who realizes near celebrity status after being accused, Ronny's ex-wife, who seems more concered about who will get the Lawton family home than anything else, and several other characters from this small town.  Collins' vision of America is dark and unseemly.  The novel is really a fabulous dark comedy, psychological drama and crime novel rolled into one.  And it works, it works fabulously well.	2002-11-17

Connelly hit a home run on the first pitch.  The story is readable, with many interesting twists--but nothing over the top.  The dialogue sparkles and the characters are real.  I picked this one up after enjoying his latest in the Harry Bosch series--City of Bones--just to see how the story began.  The Black Ice is good enough to keep you reading the entire series.

The novel weaves the family's history with that of India seamlessly.  Davidar's writing flows--it certainly demonstrates a strong talent.  There is an underlying warmth and wit in the novel that makes it a pleasure to read.  The characters all have wonderful depth and the story is often (although not all the time) very engrossing. I enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in Indian literature.	2002-11-14

It is the story of Bigelow Greene, a young man who moves to Alaska in 1915 to establish a weather station.  He becomes obsessed with a silent Aleut woman he becomes sexually involved with and when she mysteriously disappears, his world, and perhaps his sanity begin to crumble.  He becomes involved with another silent woman and his simple life grows more and more complex.  The brutal Alaskan landscape serves as an excellent backdrop for this novel and its language.  The Seal Wife is certainly not for the faint of heart--Bigelow is obsessed with sex and Harrison is not afraid to delve deeply into that obsession.  If you can take that, try this intense read.  It's hard to put down.	2002-11-14

They continue to bicker and fight like 4 year olds, although both are in their 40s.  They try to get along, but for some reason, they always fail, even when their mother, who is recuperating from a heart attack begs them to get along.  Deborah has recently moved to Florida, where her mom and sister live, trading her job writing for a soap opera for a job taking care of an historic Florida beach home (nice job).  Both sisters quickly become &quot;involved&quot; with their mom's cardiologist.  The involvement doesn't last long because star cardiologist turns up murdered.  The bickering continues, even to the police station.  Deborah, our narrator, is determined to solve the case using the &quot;skills&quot; she acquired writing for the soaps.  Sis Boom Bah is a funny tale, told in a breezy humorous style.  If you are looking for an enjoyable, romantic comedy/mystery, stop here.  It's fun and funny.	2002-11-03

A thirty-year old man still covering up his illicit behavior from fifteen years ago that may have lead to the disappearance of a friend.

Barrett's stories are all richly told and engrossing, each giving us their own world.  What is remarkable about her stories, and what sets this collection off from most others out today is her focus on the scientific world.  This focus adds an additional layer to the stories and makes them somehow richer.  The stories involve a 19th century map-maker, a 21st century science professor and early 20th century tuberculosis sufferers.  Barrett does not shy away from the scientific nature of her characters and their stories and because of this, these stories have additional layers of meaning.  These are terrific stories.  Pick them up.	2002-11-01

It tells three stories of people in a small county in Appalachia, three stories which ultimately become intertwined.  The novel, as all of Kingsolver's, is extremely well-written; however, I believe her eco-preachiness really got in the way.  Kingsolver's characters are all black and white, no shades of grey.  It is obvious from before some of these characters open their mouths who is \\"right\\" and who is wrong.  The older gentleman who wants to use pesticides on his crops--well, he doesn't stand a chance.  Kingsolver portrays him as an utter, close-minded fool.  His archnemesis, an organic farmer who lives next door--well, she's perfect.  I only wish Kingsolver had let us decide for ourselves which is the right eco-position to take instead of essentially shoving it down our throats with such obvious characterizations.  Each story line has one character who is eco-perfect and who comes up against others who aren't.  All characters come off as being almost stereotypical and much of the plotting is predicable.  So why four stars?  Kingsolver writes like a dream and Prodigal Summer is an enjoyable read.  Read it with a grain of salt and you'll be OK.	2002-10-31

It started off in almost the same mode as Slammerkin.  London city girl with checkered past travels to countryside to deceive people, but after that, the two stories diverge and this one is excellent.  The story of Maud and Sue, two young women trapped in a web of deceipt and lies, a web woven by both themselves and others is thoroughly engrossing, filled with doublecrosses and interesting plot twists.  This is a very well-done, well-told story that you can really lose yourself in.  Enjoy.	2002-10-30

Meeting her in person would be a horror show.  Reading a novel about her, however, is an amusing diversion.  Katya keeps a diary, which is then published in a London newspaper, chronicling her exploits each of which is more unbelievable than the one before.  These diary entries are the entirety of the novel.  They are brief, mostly just a couple of paragraphs, and they are generally pretty funny.  Confessions is a very short, very quick read.  If we had 500 pages of Katya, I think we would all go mad, but the book as it is is the perfect length,  enough to keep us entertained and laughing, without making us feel as if we actually had to spend time in a room alone with Katya.  Enjoy.	2002-10-28

I Don't Know How She Does It is a remarkable read--remarkable in that it is an extremely funny novel that manages to remain absolutely true to the lives of working mothers.  Instead of exaggerating Kate Reddy's (the working mom) situation, Pearson relies on a wonderfully dry wit (and the innate humor of the situation) to make us laugh.  And it's all true.  What working mom, hasn't, like Kate Reddy does in the opening paragraphs of the novel, distressed some store-bought item to make it look like she baked/cooked/prepared it?  For Kate, it's pies, for you it may be potato salad or brownies.  While most of the subject matter will make you laugh, there are other parts that may bring tears to your eyes.  Kate has an incredibly demanding work schedule, but loves her children deeply.  She is torn between her dual roles as investment banker and mommy, can't desert either of them and thus fears she is doing both of them poorly.  She muses on the situation of women in the workforce, particularly mothers throughout the novel and she hits the nail on the head every time.  I believe most working  moms will feel as if Pearson has gotten into their heads and somehow articulately, succinctly and cleverly put their thoughts and ideas on paper.  Pearson remains always true to the quandries working moms find themselves in--nothing is exaggerated for laughs, or for tears, for that matter.  The novel is terrific.  It will keep you laughing and you certainly don't have to be a working mom to appreciate it.  Kate Reddy is a wonderfully sympathetic heroine, facing real and difficult choices.  Her resolution of them all is satisfying.  A terrific novel and I must say thank you to Ms. Pearson for putting it all down on paper.  Enjoy.	2002-10-27

Somewhere in the middle of it, he's blocked.  He types away on his computer that he feels something brilliant will be coming out shortly.  It doesn't.  That is essentially how I felt about this novel.  It starts off strongly.  We meet five North American ex-pats living in Budapest in the early nineties.  Their lives are interesting, the writing is wonderful and so evocative of that time and place.  But....the novel kind of stalls in the middle.  Phillips gets lost, introduces a character in a very long sequence that just doesn't really work.  There is still much wonderful writing and storytelling in here and it is definitely worth reading.  Just don't believe the hype.	2002-10-26

Imagine, a book about the Holocaust that will make you laugh out loud.  Jonathan, a young American writer decides to travel to the Ukraine to learn, perhaps, about the woman whosaved his grandfather's life, helping him escape to America during World War II.  He doesn't speak Ukranian, and thus must hire a translator and a driver to take him to the village where his grandfather hid before escaping.  This is where the hunor comes in.  The translator/guide is also a young man, one with a bizarre knack for just missing the meaning of all of the English words he has learned.  He tells his story, as Jonathan tells the story of his ancestors.  The translator's story is incredibly funny, and Foer demonstrates a marvelous mastery of the English language to be able to mangle it so well.  Jonathan's story has a bit of magical realism thrown in--babies born from rivers, that sort of thing.  If that is not for you, perhaps this isn't the novel for you.  The translator's story, well, for the most part, that is pure comic relief, until he is forced to face demons of his own.  Everything is Illuminated is a moving and unique tale.  It is fresh and full of life and somehow manages to make you laugh and cry on the same page.	2002-10-25

Fair Warning is an enjoyable, quick read--a sort of sophisticated romance novel.  I think, based on reading other reviews on these pages, if you come to this work expecting something like Butler has done before, you may be disappointed.  If, however, you want to read a romance for grownups, this is your novel.  It is the story of Amy Dickerson, a 40 year old auctioneer with some personal issues to resolve--her father, her mother, her failed love life.  She becomes involved with two men as the novel progresses and begins to resolve some of those issues.  She eventually falls in love.  Not much else, but it is a quick compelling read which some readers will probably really enjoy.  You just have to be careful that you are one of them.	2002-10-24

Still, though, I can see that many readers love Crusie's work, and if that's you, I think you will enjoy this novel.  She's just not someone I can rave about (but I will keep reading her novels when I come across them).	2002-10-17

The Harry Potter series is a charming collection of novels and Chamber of Secrets is no exception.  Chamber is a novel with appeal to all ages, much outside the 9-12 market in the book description.  For young adults, Chamber will be a challenging and exciting read (and reread).  For adults, Chamber is fun.  It'll take you back to your youth.  One thing I find striking about J.K. Rowling is her extraordinary knack of being able to capture the essence of young adulthood.  Harry, for all his wizardness, is special and unique in the way all 12 year olds are.  His friends are great and his adventures are entertaining.  A fun read all around.	2002-10-16

I was a little disappointed when I heard that Russo's latest release was a collection of short stories.  I believe his novels are some of the best fiction being produced these days.  Still though, I ran right out and got this collection--and that's where the disappointment ended.  These stories are powerful and will stay with you.  Russo is simply a wonderful writer and these characters and their lives will inhabit your imagination for some time after reading this collection.  Enjoy.	2002-10-16

The man is a terrific, terrifying critic and it feels almost absurd to concoct a review of his collection of essays and reviews in The War Against Cliche.  Amis is a smartmouth--he doesn't hold back, but what he has to say is so witty and clever that it's OK (so long as, I think, it is not your work he is commenting on).  His writing is fabulous and he is not afraid to say exactly what he thinks, not afraid to offend anybody.  This is a great collection.	2002-10-16

You've got Twilly Spree a environmentally friendly nutcase with an unbelievable temper and a unlimited trust fund.  One day he spots Palmer Stoat, an overbloated Florida lobbiest, littering on the highway and it is there that the games begin.  Twilly begins his campaign, which at first is rather nebulous, to singlehandedly destroy Stoat.  Along the way, Twilly winds up with Stoat's dog and his wife.  The novel is entertaining and amusing, fully of humorous characters, all of them twisted in their own ways.  Sick Puppy is an enjoyable quick read.  Have fun.	2002-10-15

You will laugh your head off.  The confessions, in diary form, of Georgia Nicolson, a teenaged British girl are pure entertainment and absolutely on target.  It brings back memories with the laughs and I would recommend this novel to anyone who is either a teenage girl, or has some connection to one.  It will provide amusing insight into their lives.  Georgia is charming and hilarious.  Her parents annoy her.  She adores her three year old sister, yet struggles to understand her.  Her friends are fabulous, most of the time.  And there is this unbelievably gorgeous sex god she is, well, perhaps stalking is too strong of a word.  Anyway, I loved this novel and I look forward to reading the other two in the series.  If they are half as good as this one, they will be hilarious.	2002-10-15

It is not \\"quick\\" reading by any stretch of the imagination, so be prepared to spend some time with this one.  And be alert--you might miss something.  The novel is ostensibly about the murder of an Oxford don, and begins narrated by an Italian medical student visiting England, on a mission, he tells us, from his merchant father.  The medical student becomes involved with many of the people involved in the murder and, at the end of his narrative, gives us the murderer.  A few pages later we learn, while being beguiled by another narrator, that perhaps the medical student's vision of reality is not so true.  The novel continues, with four different narrators, and as each one goes on, the facts get more complex, the lies of the narrators more intriguing.  We ultimately find the \\"truth\\", but by the end of the novel, you will doubt much of what the narrators give you and that is half the fun of reading this novel.  You must read this one critically to get to that tiny core of truth--which goes well beyond who murdered the poor dead don.  Instance is enjoyable and impressive and if you have some time, and if you are a patient reader, I urge you to pick this one up.	2002-10-15

It is quite possible that a true mystery purist may take issue with the novel--so if that's you, consider yourself warned.  This novel is all about having fun and being amusing.  Cat Jones nanny is found dead one morning by our narrator Bailey Weggins, a newly divorced New Yorker.  Both Cat and Bailey inhabit the glamorous New York fashion magazine world.  Cat is the editor-in-chief of a Cosmo-like publication and Bailey freelances there.  The mystery has several twists and turns and it is all told with much humor.  It is an engaging story and a very quick read.  Very enjoyable, if not very deep.  A novel to have fun with and not take too seriously.  Enjoy.	2002-10-07

There is nothing wrong with Asking For Trouble, but there is nothing that distinguishes it either, save for the rather unique story.  Instead of your generic girl meets boy and is interested in him, etc. story, Asking For Trouble offers the girl hires boy to act as boyfriend, etc. storyline.  The humor is at best mildly amusing--there is nothing in here that is going to make you laugh out loud.  Additionally, Sophy, the protagonist who hires Josh to impersonate her nonexistant boyfriend for a family wedding, is pretty annoying.  She lies constantly and that behavior was frustrating to read about.  Asking For Trouble is not, however, a bad novel.  Elizabeth Young writes well and the story hangs together.  There is just nothing terrific about it.	2002-10-03

I recommend that adults who loved this book as a child return to it.  The story of Francie Nolan and her family will most likely have a different, and interesting effect on the reader.  Francie is a bright young girl growing up in a poor, but hardworking family in Brooklyn in 1912.  Although her life is a constant struggle for money, she still manages to eke out much joy.  The novel, which does not really have a plot, is rather a collection of vignettes about Francie's life.  While so much of her life appeared to be conspiring against her success, she never, ever gave up, never gave in to defeatism.  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an inspiring and a sweet story, squeaky clean, one which both young teens, and their parents should enjoy.	2002-10-01

Tepper is probably in late middle age and fairly successful-successful enough to afford garage parking for his car.  In his younger days, he couldn't afford a space and so became obsessed with finding the best on street parking.  The obsession continues, even though the need has not.  Tepper still drives around in search of the perfect space and when he finds one, he utterly relishes it, staying in his car, reading the paper.  Of course, this annoys other would be parkers because Tepper isn't going out.  His behavior gets noticed by the New York press, other New Yorkers and the mayor.  The goings on in this novel, which based on a pretty simple premise, are very amusing and witty.  Trillin Really has a way with noting the absurdities of New York and its natives.  Enjoy.	2002-09-30

The novel begins as a quaint, well-told tale about a few days on an English country estate in the 1930s.  Young Briony has written a play and is intent on staging it with her visiting cousins.  She witnesses an interchange between her older sister, Cecilia, and Robbie, their housekeeper's son, her imagination gets the better of her and she tells a lie that essentially destroys several lives.  After the lie is told, the novel jumps ahead several years, focussing on the lives of Cecilia, Robbie and ultimately Briony, as she tries to atone for her sin.  The novel then jumps forward again, it is 1999 and Briony is an accomplished writer, still, however attempting to atone for what she has done.  The closing passages of the novel are some of the most powerful I have read, ruminations on writing and the power, and the lack of power, of the written word.  Atonement is a serious piece of fiction, not something to pick up if you are in search of something light.  It may take a little patience to get into.  The first part of the novel can be a little slow (although I thought it was wonderful, something to be savored), but along the way it gains momentum and becomes utterly riveting and powerful.  If you are at all curious about Atonement, by all means pick it up.  It is a wonderful, powerful work, a rare novel.	2002-09-26

I many instances, I find a short story is an instance of excellent writing that somehow lacks the power and force of a novel, but in Haslett's case, all of these stories have tremendous power, even more than your average well done novel.

Nothing groundbreaking happens in the novel and there is not much of a plot, just the stories of the people around the lake.  You come to know their quirks, their foibles, their strengths as you read the novel.  The focal point of the novel is the house of Kate and Ruttledge, a couple who have relocated from London for a simpler life.  People stop by for a drink, or some tea and they hear all about the local gossip, they farm and raise livestock.  An ordinary story told in extraordinary fashion.  McGahern writes beautifully, with each sentence wonderfully evocative.  By the Lake is a lovely novel, to be slowly savoured.	2002-09-14

Anna Maxted's Getting Over It is one of my favorite funny novels of all time, second only to Bridget Jones' Diary.  Running In Heels, while still far superior in many ways to the many run of the mill chick lit books out there, definitely is missing something.  Yes, there is humor and yes, there is interesting plot and yes, it is intelligently written but.....it's still missing something.  Natalie, the protagonist and narrator is annoying.  She has a big issue (which I won't reveal) that Maxted introduces, with very little foundation, in the middle of the novel.  She has a best friend, Babs, but for most of the novel they are at each others' throats.  It's hard to beleive they would even allow themselves to be in the same room, let alone be friends.  The story also lacks a cohesiveness, it can be disjointed at times and it's not a particularly compelling read.  Still, I think Anna Maxted is very, very talented.  Her writing is intelligent and her humor is decidedly a bit off kilter.  I will definitely read her next novel--Getting Over It was far too good to give up after one misstep.  I think that Maxted fans should probably read Running in Heels to decide for themselves about the novel.  Although a disappointment when considered against Maxted's first novel, it is still much stronger than your standard chick lit.	2002-09-12

It truly is a &quot;rollicking&quot; read, always amusing, often hilarious.  Flashman is a highly decorated British war hero who, in his eighties decided to set the record straight and reveal what a cad and coward he is.

Ralph and Jim are likeable losers, involved with and married to, women who barely manage to put up with them.

He lives a pretty idyllic life until he leaves his southwestern home for an easter boarding school.  Ellis can handle the studies and his annoying roommate fairly well, it's just the lack of pot and lack of the Goatman he finds hard to deal with.

All are in the same French town, and each one affects the characters who exist after them.  The story flows marvelously, moving seamlessly from one historical period to the next.  The three main characters are concerned with, and perhaps obessessed with making morally correct decisions in an seemingly immoral world.  Each lives in a time when tremendous calamities of historical consequences were occuring around them and all over Europe.  The decisions they make are not easy and the later characters look for guidance to a writing by the Manlius, the first of the characters.  The Dream of Scipio is a highly interesting read, on that I enjoyed immensely. If you are not afraid of a philisophically grounded novel, pick this one up.  You won't regret it.	2002-09-05

The patriarch, Sunny Jim Whitelaw, has just died, leaving a will requiring one of his daughters to reconcile with her estranged husband, a man with a storied and bizarre relationship with Jim, before the release of his main asset, a bottling plant, for public sale.  The story follows the family--Jim's wife, two daughters and his friend and ranch foreman, Bill Champion--in the months after his death.  All of these characters are a little offbeat, a little bizarre, and there are a number of surprises in their stories, and in Jim's as well.  McGuane's writing style, as well, is a little offbeat, a little bizarre, but the novel is refreshing, a little different.	2002-09-03

He can't find another job and so devises a twisted plan to find one.  Burke is bitter about his loss and Westlake does a wonderful job conveying that bitterness, which I found remarkably convincing given Westlake's own successes.  Burke's story is amusing but Burke himself is utterly despicable.  His solution is the ultimate rationalization, one which goes too far over the line.  The novel grabs you from the first page and is an engaging, quick read.  Enjoy	2002-09-03

Lyman Ward, a fifty-something professor whose own marriage has disintegrated has returned to his childhood home to write of the marriage of his grandparents, perhaps to determine why their marriage lasted through tremendous adversity when his own could not.  His grandparents, Susan and Oliver Ward met in New York the 1870s, where she was a promising illustrator and he an engineer.  They marry and travel West, living in various places, California, Idaho.  Susan feels that she never quite fits into this &quot;uncivilized&quot; place, expressing her unsettleness beautifully in her letters to her good friend Augusta, who lives the life in New York that perhaps Susan felt she was destined to live.  Lyman is fascinated with his grandmother, telling her story as he discovers how it unfolds through reading these Augusta letters, adding what he remembers from his own childhood.  Lyman suffers from a degenerative bone disease and must rely on young Shelly Rasmussen to help him construct this book on his grandmother.  Shelly has just escaped a failed &quot;marriage&quot; of her own.  Lyman tells the story of his grandmother while also telling us both his and Shelly's stories seamlessly.  Stegner's writing is beautiful and evocative.  Angle of Repose is a big, beautiful, unique novel.  Stegner's method of weaving the stories together works marvelously and so many of his sentences are simply perfect.   Susan Ward's life(and Lyman's and Shelly's) is the believable story of a flawed human being--it's not picture perfect--there are no rosy endings for us here.  However, the novel is very satisfying.  Highly recommended.	2002-09-03

Lisa Lerner gives us a unique spin on those angst-ridden teen years in Just Like Beauty.  Just Like Beauty takes place in the not too distant future--a future where teenage girls compete in bizarre beauty contests with competitions like freestyle walking and mystery powders, a future where every suburban home has its own insecticide hut, a future where every product is &quot;just like&quot;  (Just Like Heavy Cream, Just Like Lemon Spray Wax).  Edie Stein, the teenage protagonist in Just Like Beauty believes she is  a shoo-in to win the beauty contest--if she can only avoid attacks from the roving gangs of teenage boys who terrorize young women.  She's an amusing, deadpan narrator, who isn't the slightest bit astonished (as the reader will be) at the condition of her world.  She's not 100% convinced that this beauty contest is the way to go, and her budding friendship with Lana, her beautiful next door neighbor continues to confuse her.  Just Like Beauty is a bit of an odd novel.  The future Lerner gives us is almost like the present in a parallel universe.  It is, however, a unique commentary on the perils of adolescence, told in with a unique spin.	2002-08-29

Basket Case's protagonist, Jack Tagger was once a promising journalist, but he got into trouble with management and is now banished to writing obituaries, which he somehow manages to make amusing for the reader (of the novel, probably not of the obituaries).  He learns of the death of a former rock star, and the fun begins.  Tagger sees a story in the death, sees that the story being told is not the truth.  He digs deeper, believing that this may be his ticket back onto the front page.  His experience makes an enjoyable, amusing read.	2002-08-28

Jeremy, our narrator, is a hilariously charming protagonist, unsure of himself, yet still pretty OK.  He navigates his sophmore year quite well, dealing with making friends, handling family, getting a girlfriend.  He's a believable character telling a believable story.  Weisberg does a great job bringing back high school and all the uncertainties that go along with it.  Be warned that this novel is written as if by a 10th grader with less than stellar punctuation skills.  A sentence starts, runs on, no commas, semicolons, etc., and then ends with a period.  Reading it is like talking to an out of breath teenager.  (Which is fun).  This novel will make you laugh out loud and it will also bring some wistful tears to your eyes.  Enjoy.	2002-08-26

I read that one ages ago, and I remember liking it a bit more than Long Time No See.  LTNS, while funny,  has a bit of a pacing problem.  It starts off fairly well, but then, as soon as Judith gets involved in solving the murder mystery, the story drags.  She interviews what seemed to be countless people who could tell her nothing.  And then, in a whirlwind, the story is wrapped up.  Not bad, just not great either.	2002-08-26

The novel focuses on the people surrounding (some directly, some indirectly) Alice Valentine, a dying woman in Great Britain.  Her older son, Larry, is trying to save his marriage and his finances, while ruining his acting career through porn movies.  Her younger son Alec is trying to see which portions of his life are worth saving, while at the same time trying to help his mother in any way he can.  He is a translator of plays by Laszlo Lazar, a Hungarian exile living in Paris.  The novel also focuses on Lazar's attempt to reconcile his current life, with the life he left behind in Hungary.  All the novel's characters are real people, with real stories.  Well done.	2002-08-25

Pelecanos focuses on Derek Strange, a private investigator in DC and his partner Terry Quinn.  The novel follows several story lines, some of which become intertwined, some of which don't.  Reading it reminded me of watching an episode of C.S.I.--addictive, enjoyable, filled with various, disturbing story lines.  The characters are very well-done, rounded, believable.  All in all, an enjoyable read which I think will appeal to all--not just fans of crime novels.	2002-08-16

Much went on in England, and Birmingham, at the time--strikes, pub bombings--and that affects the story in the novel.  But equally important and disastrous are the goings on in the individual families--extramarital affairs, deaths, disappearances.  These all happen, yet the boys in the novel manage to have an amusing trip into adulthood.  They come of age, despite everything, and manage to do OK.  The novel will make you laugh out loud and it will make you think about the sadnesses in life.  I really enjoyed this one.  Coe is a talented, very funny writer.  Enjoy.	2002-08-11

Yes, there is much humor and wit, and engaging heroine, but that's about it.  There was so much in here she could have developed--the poker nights for example.  Ruby Capote, our heroine, who has moved from Boston to New York to escape a going-nowhere relationship, establishes a poker night with some women friends.  These friend characters needed to be a little more developed than they were.  I had trouble figuring out who was who and I didn't really care that much anyway.  The novel is full of very short little chapters that leave you wanting more.  I found this one to be a bit of a disappointment.  Had it been funnier, had the story been more developed, had Davis allow me to care about any of the characters (just one of those elements, not all of them), it could have been a better, more enjoyable book.	2002-08-09

The writing is beautiful, although I must say, the author's decision not to use quotation marks didn't work for me with this one.  Jiles is a poet, which is obvious throughout the novel.  The story of Adair Colley starts of rather slowly.  She is a young Missouri woman who is taken prisoner during the Civil War.  While in prison, she is interrogated by Major William Neumann.  Despite their differences, they fall in love.  (There is no way to describe it without making it sound like some trite romance novel, is there?)  They are separated and she travels the long journey home--hoping to find her father, her sisters, her horse, her home.  Needless to say, it is a difficult journey.  There are no surprises in this novel, but the writing is beautiful and it does vividly portray the horror of the Civil War.  The story, despite its predictability is compelling.	2002-08-09

Michael, masquerading as Gregory at a book reading, is offered a position in a psychiatric clinic as a writer-in-residence, part of the therapy for those being treated there.  Bedlam Burning is also a witty examination of what it is to read, what it is to write, who, and how much, we can believe.  Michael almost immediately begins getting submissions from everyone at the clinic.  As he ruminates on these submissions, you may wonder, who is really writing these?  Can you believe it at all?  Gregory keeps coming back into Michael's life, complicating things, but allowing Nicholson to give us more ruminations on the nature of writing, authorship and reading.  The novel is engaging, humorous and witty.  The characters are just that--characters.  The story moves along fairly quickly and it works.  An enjoyable read.	2002-08-08

The Lovely Bones is a wonderful, hopeful, moving read.  The story is narrated by Susie Salmon--a fourteen year-old girl who in the opening moments of the novel, informs us that she is dead--brutally raped and then murdered.  That's the worst of it--right there.  The novel is her story, what heaven is like (Sebold's version of heaven is nothing if not comforting), what her afterlife is like--watching her family and friends struggle to move on.  Susie's story is interesting and unique.  This novel would have been quite depressing if told in the third person, if all we saw were the grieving friends and family.  Instead, we see it all from Susie's perspective, as she tries to comfort them, tries to help them move on.  The most wonderful part of the novel, though, is how it makes you feel as you read it--something difficult to convey in a review.  Sebold fills the novel with emotion, without allowing it to become sappy and over the top.  The ending is very satisfying.  OK, maybe it tied things up too neatly--but because of the subject matter, the best it can be is bittersweet.  I urge anyone who is interested in The Lovely Bones to read it.  Don't be put off by what appears to be the subject matter.  This really is a truly emotionally satisfying novel.	2002-08-01

Josh McGowan has been assigned to bring a young female former Soviet operative to the US after she escaped from a Russian prison.  Of course, nothing is ever easy, and Josh meets with many compelling roadblocks along the way.  The story is told in an engaging fashion--readable, detailed, exciting.  Josh, and the story, were not overwhelmingly &quot;macho&quot;.  The plot is full of many interesting twists, which are all grounded in reality.  Enjoy.	2002-07-31

Donoghue's imaginative story begins in London, when Mary is 13. She is intrigued by the young prostitutes she shes on the streets when she is not where she should be.  Their brightly colored gowns and &quot;free&quot; lifestyles appeal to young Mary.  She lives with her mother and stepfather in a joyless household without much hope of a future other than following in her mothers footsteps as a seamstress.  She soon loses even that hope through her own foolish desire for a pretty ribbon.  Donoghue follows Mary through her life as a prostitute, her attempt at reform, her escape from London, to the town of Monmouth where her past finally catches up with her.  Mary's vain materialism is what ultimately brings her down and although at times she isn't the most likeable protagonist, you can't help but be disappointed in the outcome.  That is not to say that the book is a disappointing at all.  Quite the contrary.  Slammerkin is an engaging, thought-provoking tale that explores the limited options women had in those times--prostitute or slave--or so it seems to Mary.  There is a solution to those lack of options that Donoghue shows to us, and Mary almost takes that solution, but ultimately, she cannot.  I enjoyed Slammerkin very much.  It is the kind of novel that will make you think long past the time you have finished it. Enjoy.	2002-07-29

The stories all take place somewhere in middle America--I'm picturing Indiana, Illinois.  The characters are essentially losers--no one is a smashing success, everyone is flawed, yet the stories are not depressing.  Reading them is like looking at the underside of a rock.  You know these people are out there, they are just not in your world all the time--but look closely and they are fascinating.  Enjoy.	2002-07-24

I really enjoyed the novel, but I can see how many would absolutely hate it.  I think if you are looking for a Western in the Lonesome Dove vein, keep looking and don't pick this one up.  I think the publishers do this novel a disservice by packaging it in the manner of Lonesome Dove.  If you enjoy a good toungue-in-cheek romp, one that will take you a little below the surface if you want to, then give Sin Killer a try.  Larry McMurtry is certainly a talented writer.  I have read many of his novels, and on the storytelling level, none ever fail to disappoint and in that connection Sin Killer makes enjoyable reading.  The story of the Berrybender family--an eccentric collection of British nutcases in the early 18th century who decide to explore the American west on a steamboat so the borderline insane patriarch can go hunting--is, of course, absurd.  The story, however, allows McMurtry to explore the differences between American and British culture at the time, enabling him to smash through the assumptions that the Americans were wild and uncivilized.  Most characters in the novel (except for perhaps the Sin Killer himself) are full of folly and hubris, and McMurtry exploits them to our benefit.  The characters in the novel form a microcosm of their respective societies--everyone being an exaggeration.  The story is fun and makes for fun reading (so long as you can forget you ever read Lonesome Dove).  If you can handle this one not being anything like Lonesome Dove (other than it being written by McMurtry and taking place in the American West), if you are looking for an enjoyable, humorous read, pick this one up.  It's a lot of fun.	2002-07-19

The experience of reading the novel is a bit irritating at times because Elissa herself is irritating.  Smith's writing is excellent and consistent throughout.  I personally had a hard time with Elissa.  She is not a sympathetic protagonist--she annoys everyone in the novel as well.  The novel is still interesting because of Smith's writing and what he was trying to accomplish.  He examines whether one can actually live by one's principles, when those principles include never trying to please anyone, not even yourself.	2002-07-19

Ridley tells a disturbing, yet still completely compelling story that is so good, you can almost get caught up in enjoying it and forget he's got quite a strong message in there too.  The novel (and it is a novel) tells the story of Jackie Mann--a comedian from Harlem, born in the late 30s--who overcomes tremendous racism to become a &quot;success&quot; at least as he thinks it is.  So many times in the novel, Jackie is forced to swallow his pride, to sell out, to give in, all for what he believes is the right thing, his way to the top.  Jackie's story is juxtaposed against the civil rights movement of the sixties.  Jackie is at the height of his fame when that movement reached its crescendo.  He tries to ignore the messages of that movement, but ultimately, he cannot.  He makes a choice--the end results of which are a departure for him--it's a depressing, but uplifting at the same time.  Jackie's story is amazing and the early years are especially upsetting--but that's what makes the novel so important.  Read it, enjoy it, think about it.	2002-07-16

It's a well-written novel about a likeable guy who is down on his luck, with a [messed] up love life and a going nowhere career.  The thing that makes it unique is that it takes place essentially in the Arctic Circle on a variety of small ships staffed with a collection of odd souls.  The writing and the storyline unfold naturally and it is an enjoyable read.  Henry Seine, the protagonist, for so me reason kept reminding me of the protagonist in Empire Falls.  Same set of general circumstances, with an utterly different setting.  Henry ultimately decides his way to salvation is to assemble a crew to save a man he believes stranded somewhere in the Arctic Circle.  Their adventures make for enjoyable reading, and 2182 Khz is an engaging novel.	2002-07-15

A word of warning:  there is not much of a plot and if that's going to bother you, then perhaps this novel isn't for you.  Unless is narrated by Reta Winters, an author who, while attempting to write her second novel, must deal with the painful actions of her oldest daughter.  Norah, her nineteen-year old daughter has dropped out of college and taken to panhandling in Toronto.  She is in an almost catatonic state, and won't speak to her family.  The mystery of why Norah is behaving like this is almost destroying Reta, yet somehow she goes on with her life.  This novel is her account of what that life is like.  It is intelligently written.  Reta is a smart, quick narrator.  It isn't until the end of the novel that the actual story gets moving.  You finally get the sense that a resolution with Norah, and with Reta's novel, may be ahead.  Shields is saying a lot in this novel--much about being a writer and the creative process, but there is also some feminism in there too.  The novel is fairly brief--a little over 200 pages, but Sheilds manages to fit much in those pages.  Unless is a thought-provoking, thoughtful read.  Enjoy	2002-07-10

The story is simple, yet complex at the same time and can be read on many levels.  On the surface, this is the story of a young man who grows up in India and at sixteen, en route to Canada with his family, finds himself the sole human survivor of a shipwreck, afloat on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger.  The story is divided into two sectins.  The first occurs before he gets on the boat and tells of his life as a young zookeeper's son.  As a boy, he decides to become a practicing Catholic, Muslim and Hindu, all at once. His ruminations on zookeeping and religion lay the groundwork for how he could possibly survive on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger.  Beyond the story, however, is an examination of religion and of writing, of how to write about religion and the religious experience.  It is an examination on the strengths (and weaknesses) of religious belief.  The novel also ends with a philisophical bang, which I won't give away, but which did blow me away.  It wasn't until I got to that point that I became truly impressed with what Martel has done here.  Before that, I thought it was a very well done novel, but with the ending, it becomes much more.  Life of Pi is not a typical novel.  The story, its charming main character and his narrative style are all different than most everything else you can get today.  That uniqueness makes it that much more special.  I highly recommend Life of Pi.  Enjoy.	2002-07-09

Not A Kid Just Like Me.  Bruce Roseman's first person account of teaching his learning disabled, ADD son to read is inspiring and enjoyable reading.  I think all parents can learn from Dr. Roseman's story.  Dr. Roseman has been blessed with a wonderful son, Joshua, whom he loves dearly.  Throughout the entire ordeal recounted in the book of dealing with educators, administrators, etc., Dr. Roseman never, ever forgot the love for his child, he never gave up, he always was his child's strongest advocate.  While people were telling him and his wife that Joshua would never learn to read, he took control of the situation and taught his son to read.  Dr. Roseman is also honest about himself in this book--he admits many time that he was a bit of a pill to those he encountered--again, though, all for his son.  Dr. Roseman sent me this book, and asked me to review it.  I am so thankful he did.  It is a wonderful work that I recommend all parents read.  It contains a compelling, heartwarming (although also sometimes heartbreaking) story that will inspire all parents.	2002-07-03

The Nutmeg of Consolation is no exception.  If you have gotten this far in the series, there is absolutely no reason to stop now.  This one takes place primarily in the South Pacific and Australia, and therefore does not have much in the domestic life of Aubrey and Maturin.  The novel opens when they are stranded on an island in the South Pacific.  Adventures naturally ensue, and ultimately, they find themselves in Australia, clashing to a certain extent with the locals.  All in all, a completely enjoyable novel, filled with the humor, the action, the human drama that we come to expect in the Aubrey-Maturin series.  Enjoy.	2002-06-28

At the beginning of the novel, she is spending a Memorial Day picnic with friends she has had since high school, including her fiance, Mike.  Carrie has pretty much had it with the relationship with Mike, and he suspects it too.  She is also beginning to get a bit bored with her friends too, including Jamie, her best friend for many years.  Things suddenly change for everyone at the picnic when Mike dives off the pier, and breaks his neck, and is permanently paralyzed.  Carrie, who can be a bit of an ice queen, as far as narrators go, can't really decide what to do now.  She is still a bit bored with her life, and although she doesn't say it, suspects she has outgrown many of her relationships in Madison.  None of her friends ever left Madison.  They simply went to the University there and stayed on after graduation.  Ultimately, she and Mike break up and to escape the ignominy and shame she fears will no doubt follow, she drives to New York City.  Her choice may alienate some readers, while others may be angered when she finally decides what to do at the end of the novel, but I think most will appreciated her story and understand how as a person she was able to grow.  I found Carrie's story compelling and completely readable.  I literally could not put the book down for the last 100 pages or so because I had to see what she decides to do.  As I said, as a narrator, she can be a bit chilly, which makes sense given her fear that the story she is relating may seem selfish (which I believe it ultimately is not).  I highly recommend this novel and believe that most readers will fully enjoy it.	2002-06-27

So I ran out and got The Emperor of Ocean Park.  While the novel is far from perfect, it has a good many qualities which I think many will enjoy.  One thing I appreciated was its accurate portrayal of the legal world.  Carter has some brilliant and on target observations of that world, particularly of that of the law school that are a refreshing departure from, let's say, the works of John Grisham.  Another strong point is the entirely plausible plot.  It is grounded in reality, without being dull or boring.  Professor Carter is clearly a very intelligent person, and his writing, for the most part, reflects that.  I do, however, have a few complaints about the novel--my main complaint being that his editor appears to have forgotten to actually edit.  This novel is very long, and probably could have been better if it were about 100 pages shorter.  I also warn that the ending is a bit frustrating--some may be disappointed by it--but that's all I am going to say.  Overall, however, The Emperor of Ocean Park is a well written and engaging novel which I believe most will enjoy.	2002-06-24

While it is well-written, the story is just a series of tragedy piled upon tragedy.  After a while, I couldn't care at all about any of the characters because I knew they were all doomed, and there was nothing in them to like anyway.  This is the story of a Canadian family which essentially destroys itself.  Reading it is like watching a train wreck in slow motion over and over again.	2002-06-21

Clare Verey a 29 year old married woman is the focal point of the novel, with chapters alternating between her story and those of the various members of her extended family--half brother, stepmother, father, etc.  Each character has his or her faults and foibles exposed to us.  May of the characters seem to naturally gravitate to the wrong type of person, the wrong type of relationship.  When I read back the words I have just written, I realize that I have painted a rather bleak picture of a definitely unbleak novel.  Accidents in the Home is quite an enjoyable read, well-told and engaging.  The characters are likeable, their flaws, forgivable.  Enjoy.	2002-06-20

I think most women will see at least a trace (and some much more than a trace) of themselves in Becky.  She shops like crazy and rationalizes every overpriced purchase.  Who hasn't bought something on sale thinking that they were actually saving money.  (Unfortunately, when you read about Becky doing so, you'll see your logical lapse).  Becky is a charming heroine, and Confessions of a Shopaholic is a fun and very funny read.  There is not a speck of depth in the novel, so if you're looking for that, look elsewhere.  This, like most romantic comedies of it's kind, is a just an enjoyable, engaging light read.  Enjoy.	2002-06-19

The plot is sharp and original--but be warned--this book is not written for the faint of heart--there is a fair amount of violence and profanity.  I found this book to be quite enjoyable and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good thriller.  Put this one in your carry-on bag for you next flight.

The novel, which is narrated by Kate, a scientist in her late twenties, begins with the death of both of Kate's parents in a car accident, an accident which leaves Kate and her three siblings orphans.  I know what you are thinking--sounds like Oprah, sounds predictable, we see where this is going.  Well, it's none of those things and it will take you some place else.  Lawson delves into the depths of family relationships, of familial expectations and love.  One of the things that makes this book different is Kate's narrative style.  We follow the story of what happened after her parents were killed, as that story somehow collides with her present story.  She has been invited back to Crow Lake, doesn't know if she can handle it, doesn't know if she should take her current boyfriend.  Her current predicaments are all caused by what happened to her family so many years ago and it's fascinating and thought-provoking.  Mary Lawson has given us a terrific novel, an engaging read.  Highly recommended.	2002-05-27

The slowness was more a function of my available time than of the novel's quality.  Johnno is a little gem, a wonderful chronicling of a young man's coming of age, and his relationship with Johnno, a slightly troubled young man, in Brisbane right after World War II.  David Malouf is a wonderful writer.  Each sentence is a work of art--but nothing is too precious, too anything.  It's an enjoyable book that I highly recommend.	2002-05-21

I made an exception for this one and will read the other two in the series because Fellowship of the Ring is just so well done.  If you love fantasy, well, you've probably already read this one, but if it's just not your thing, try this one.  It's definitely written on a much more sophisticated level than The Hobbit.  It's readable, it's engaging and it doesn't go over the top at all.  One warning:  the novel just ends pretty much in the middle of the action, so you'll probably want to run right out and pick up The Two Towers--just be prepared to devote a large block of time to reading the series.  Have fun.	2002-05-20

His book clearly explains his theories on the many different areas a child's mind develops as he or she grows up, and what happens if certain areas lag behind.  He offers advice (although I wish there were a little more) on what to do if your child needs a little boost in any particular area.  This theory behind this book reminded me very much of the Howard Gardner Multiple Intelligences theory--but I found Levine's much more practical and accessible.  Levine breaks down mental development into about 6 different categories, such as memory, language, focus and social development.  Each one of these categories has its own chapter and in each chapter each category is then further broken down.  Levine gives you ways to recognize if and to what degree a particular child may need help in a particular subcategory and explains that in each category, particular children may be very strong in some areas and much weaker in others.  (For instance, a child's memory may be strong in only in the long term, but not the short term--it's not always consistent).  Levine also devotes a few chapters to an introduction to his theories and application in schools and in the home.  This book is not, of course, the answer to everything--but it will direct parents to where they need to find additional answers with respect to their individual children.  Levine's approach to childhood development is refreshing.  He rejects labeling children (as ADD, ADHD, etc.) for the most part as overgeneralizing and negative.  He reminds us that while some children may need help in certain areas, all children have their own strenghths and that we ought to focus on those in helping them develop.  He provides many anecdotal evidence of how his theories have helped particular children.  I recommend this book for all parents.  I think it will help them to better understand, and help, their children.	2002-04-30

Who is going to buy a short story collection entitled:  &quot;A Collection of Well Written Stories from a Bunch of Different People, from 1915 to 1999&quot;.  Not catchy and you can't dance to it.  Another fact--there is no way that you could put together a collection of the greatest American short stories from the 20th century and have everyone agree on it.  That being said, this is a very good collection of stories.  I will admit, some bored me, some I really didn't like, but there is a lot in there and on the whole I think it's a worthwhile read.  Some of the stories blew me away--particularly Alice Elliot Dark's In the Gloaming.  Some, I couldn't even finish.  As a whole, I am very glad I read them.  This collection introduced me to a number of writers I had never read before, some I haven't read in a while, and some I read anytime anything new comes out.  Of the stories I enjoyed (and that's most of them), I am appeciative of Updike's including them.  This collection, while it has a few weak links, is strong and makes for enjoyable reading.	2002-04-19

I picked up this book because one of my children has a tendency to explode at inappropriate times and I was searching for some answers.  I found that I am not alone, and that I really don't have it so bad after all.  Dr. Greene offers wonderful advice on prioritizing your battles with your children that I think can apply to all parents.  You simply determine what is important, what is trivial and what falls in between.  Ultimatley, everything can become important, but when establishing behavioural rules with children, Greene advocates a sort of sliding scale approach which has been working with my children.  As I said above, I think this book will help almost all parents--so don't be put off by the title.	2002-04-12

I agree with other reviewers here that I wish she would branch out a bit--but her staying with what she knows does not take away from the enjoyability of Bonesetter's Daughter.  Ruth is a modern woman who loves, and to a certain extent, loathes, her mother.  Her mother, as well, had a very difficult relationship with her own mother.  The Bonesetter's Daughter focuses on these relationships and tells an interesting story--one that keeps those pages turning.  I enjoyed reading the novel. It's a quick, engaging read--particularly the part of the novel where Ruth's mother gets to tell her own story.  Tan isn't breaking any new ground here--but I've said before--you don't have to read War and Peace all the time.  Enjoy this one.	2002-04-12

I admit, I tried starting it a couple of times in high school, but just couldn't get past the first few pages.  Fantasy fiction is not really my thing, however, now that I have finally gotten around to reading The Hobbit (many years after high school) I enjoyed it.  The Hobbit is a well written, engaging, and oftentimes humorous work of fantasy.  It is aimed at a youthful audience and I think it would be a marvelous next step for young people who have gotten through Harry Potter and long for more.  If you've been saying you should read this one, just pick it up, there's no sense waiting anymore.<br />Enjoy.	2002-04-04

I was looking forward to a funny, entertaining look at nanny life in New York City.  What I got instead was at times a one-sided diatribe where it seemed the authors were venting their dual frustrations at being nannies.  The book can be very funny at times--as writers I think at least one of them (maybe both, hard to tell) shows great promise.  Their observations are many times right on, perfect.  Ultimately, however, I found the plot and the characters to border on the ridiculous.  I have to confess upfront:  I am a working mother and have had \\"nannies\\" (although I never use that term) for about six years.  Given my experience and those of numerous other working mothers I think I can say that this book does not ring true for a number of reasons.  First, let me say that I would hire Nanny, the character in the novel, in a heartbeat.  A caring, responsible college student with a true love of children, someone hardworking and honest--if she's for real she can find a job anywhere.  For some reason, Nan takes and keeps a job with perhaps the most selfish character in all modern literature.  She and her husbands are absolute monsters.  For some inexplicable reason, they have the world's most wonderful child, which is why Nan doesn't just walk right out of their wonderfully furnished Park Avenue apartment when she gets her first sense that her employers, the Xes, are the devil incarnate.  The whole thing just struck me as unrealistic.  It seemed that every parent Nan ran across was a wicked nightmare.  Every nanny, on the other hand, was a vision of saintliness.  That's where the one-sidedness comes in.  The little plot available covers her involvement with a nice guy with hideous friends and the affair Mr. X has with a woman essentially as equally horrible as Mrs. X.  <br />You may think, as a working mom, I've got a chip on my shoulder, an axe to grind.  Perhaps.  But I have been their down in the trenches, have hiredtwo nannies, interviewed countless more, listened to many friends horrifying babysitter stories.  Believe me, there is a lot more to the story than McLaughlin and Kraus share.  If you are not a working mom, or mom with a nanny, you may find this novel amusing.  But characters as evil as the Xes and as wonderful as Nan belong in another novel.  The Nanny Diaries takes itself far too seriously to contain such exaggerated characters.  These characters belong in a farce of some sort--a work where you know they reflect a distorted version of reality.  Instead McLaughlin and Kraus have inserted in their witty, observant novel--and for me, it just doesn't work.  I wish them well, they can write, but frankly, I found The Nanny Diaries a little too spiteful for my taste.	2002-03-26

The whole crime-mystery genre thing is something I have never really explored.  After reading The Last Dance, I don't know why.  I really enjoyed the novel--it is a quick, engaging, almost addictive read.  I found it to be the literary equivalent of Law and Order or CSI.  There is a collection of crusty detectives in fictional city that reminded me much of NYC; there is an ever-growing collection of dead bodies, and an ever-growing collection of suspects.  The story is well told, the dialogue is real, the characters are both amusing and believable.  This series is definitely one I will return to when I am looking for a quick, engaging read. I also intend to share this series with the people in my life who don't read, but who enjoy Law and Order.  Maybe this will make them readers.	2002-03-15

Beautiful NY model loses face in car crash and struggles to regain her life.  It's a interesting premise, but Egan certainly doesn't stop there.  She explores the superficiality of our contemporary culture and its bizarre obsessions with a well done, insightful narrative.  Charlotte, the model with the new face is not a supermodel, but a fairly successful, very smart, mid-30s woman who has seen it all, and thus sees much of what she sees for what it is.  Charlotte's descriptions of what she sees in New York are sometimes scarily on target.  The details of Charlotte's car accident are somewhat unclear, and to let us know what happened, Egan brings in another Charlotte--this one a teenager (and the daughter of model-Charlotte's high school best friend) seeking answers through her studies with her slightly mentally unstable professor uncle and her affair with a mysterious new high school math teacher.  We follow the lives of both Charlottes for the months following the accident.  Model Charlotte returns to New York and tries to develop a new life because her old one has essentially vanished with her old face.  She becomes involved with a new internet venture--a sort of webcam meets Big Brother meets Real Life meets People magazine (the concept itself is a brilliant, thought-provoking idea on Egan's part).  Teenage Charlotte is living in model Charlotte's old home town in the Midwest simply dealing with the difficulties of teenage life--and her involvement with these two older men.<br />Look At Me is a terrific novel, it's only flaw being that sometimes it gets a little too ambitious.  It seems at times Egan is trying to communicate a message, but hasn't come up with a concrete way of communicating it.  This, however, does not distract from the wonderful and thought provoking story this novel tells.  Enjoy.	2002-03-10

The story looks that way--you know, young woman in New York deals with the fact her fiance has two other \\"fiances\\", and then moves on with her life.  There are a lot of similar stories out there--despite that, I do enjoy them.  This book, however, was something different, something a little more.  Sandy, the young woman in the novel is a real person.  She doesn't bounce back immediately and begin dating tons of men in some sort of happy-go-lucky, light-hearted fashion.  No, she is upset and depressed and turns to a close friend, a gay man who unfortunately lives 3000 miles away, for support.  Despite the fact that she is down, the novel itself will not bring you down.  Sandy is witty (not Bridget Jones witty, more like your sarcastic best friend witty) and she gets herself out of the dumps in a realistic way.  This novel is also an accurate version of what life was like in NYC for a single young woman in the mid to late eighties.  The people, the places, the pastimes, it was all there.  A couple complaints though.  I thought the story started off fairly slowly.  Witchel bounces around time-wise in a way that bogs the novel down.  After about 80 pages or so, when she gets into the present, things pick up and the novel becomes much more can't-put-downable.  If you are looking for a slight departure from the fairy tale romantic comedy, if you are looking for a slightly darker, more realistic side of single life (more like In the Drink or Otherwise Engaged), this is your novel.

The story is simple--two young couples meet and become lifelong friends--but the way it is told is not.  Stegner does something magical with the English language, his words are so evocative.  After reading one scene, which takes place during a summer rainstorm, I was shocked to look outside my own window to see dry ground, barren branches.  What I find amazing about this work is that Stegner is able to convey so much without being overly verbose.  Sally, Larry, Sid and Charity meet as young professors and their wives in Madison Wisconsin in the late 30s.  Sid and Charity are wealthy, Sally and Larry are not.  Larry tells us the story many years later, as all have gathered because Charity is gravely ill.  They have returned to the New England family &quot;camp&quot; where much of the narrative takes place.  Successes, failures, marital problems, children, travels, careers--its all here, told in a marvelous fashion.  I think I fell in love with this novel from the first sentence.  If you can, pick it up in the early morning, when the rest of your household is sleeping.  Spend some time alone with this novel and Stegner will transport you to another time and place.  I highly recommend this remarkable novel.	2002-02-19

But, I urge you to determine if it is for you.  If it is, you certainly don't want to miss it.  This novel was not written with today's readers in mind.  You cannot call it quick-paced, by any stretch of the imagination.  The novel is however, a wonderful work of art.  Every sentence, every word is carefully crafted, carefully chosen.  This novel is meant to be read slowly, to be savored.  The novel tells a fairly simple story--the story of the house, and its perhaps doomed family of inhabitants.  Many years after a curse by a supposed warlock--there are only 4 members of the doomed family surviving.  Is the house haunted?  Maybe.  Hawthorne is so clever--every time he tells us about a supposed ghost or haunting, he gives us a more &quot;reasonable&quot; explanation.  Were they ghosts swirling around the house one evening, or was it just the wind.  Is the family doomed?  Maybe, but then there is young Pheobe who seems anything but.  The House of Seven Gables is far superior to any contemporary gothic you can read.  It is novel writing at its best.  The characters have depth, the story is engaging, and even, at times, funny.  But, you have to be ready for a novel written well over a hundred years ago.  If you are, you are in for a treat.	2002-02-05

Milkrun, while not rising to the Getting Over It, Rachel's Holiday, Bridget Jones level in quality is certainly a very strong, very enjoyable novel.  Another admission:  I'm not in my twenties, and I was still able to enjoy this novel, if only for the nostalgic elements.  Milkrun tells the story of Jackie, a young twenty something who has just been dumped in an email by her boyfriend who is &quot;finding himself&quot; in Thailand.  Unfortunately for Jackie, he also found a leggy Dutch blonde.  With the help of her friends and a number of cocktails, she sets out to recover from this jerk (appropriately named Jer).  She hits the Boston bar scene and embarks on a number of bad (but bad in a hilarious way) dates, until she finally discovers what it is she is looking for.  This novel is a funny lark--there is not one serious sentence in there.  Jackie is an endearing narrator--she'll make you chuckle, she'll make you laugh out loud.  I recommend this novel for all romantic comedy fans.  It won't let you down.	2002-01-23

It's an engaging page turner, and, if you don't mind the fact that it's narrated by a ghost, you'll probably like it.  Five Mile House tells the story of two women, one in the present, one in the past, whose looks are not the only thing that tie them together.  In the present, there is Leslie Stone, a former police officer who killed a child murderer in a fit of rage.  Her husband moves their family to Wellington, a small New England town where he is to work on the renovations of Five Mile House.  Five Mile House is where the other woman, Eleanor Bly apparently murdered all of her children.  The ghost of Eleanor Bly &quot;haunts&quot; the house.  Leslie, in her recovery, tries to get to the bottom of the mystery of Eleanor Bly, and in her search, discovers current mysteries of Wellington.  As I said, this is an engaging pageturner, if you can handle the gothic elements in it.	2002-01-23

David Sedaris' Me Talk Pretty One Day is a very amusing collection of essays that I enjoyed, so long as I read them one or two at a time.  I personally found, after reading more than that, that Sedaris's narcissism started getting on my nerves.  That being said, these essays are very amusing, some more than others of course.  A good portion of them concern his move to France, although many focus on his family.  Sedaris story telling style relies heavily on the humorous exaggeration, and for the most part it works.  Again though, after too many essays, it may grate on your nerves.  This book is a fun read, definitely nontaxing (for instance, I was easily able to read these essays in a moving car (I wasn't driving)).  Enjoy.	2002-01-20

The novel is well-written and funny and contains wonderful characters.  The story takes place in Springfield Illinois in the hot, hot summer of 1999.  Josie, a disaffected 17 year old lives with her divorced mother and spends the summer working at Taco Bell, avoiding her father, and stalking a gorgeous young policeman who wandered into her life one day.  Her mother, Elaine, who tries so hard to be happy, is also trying to help her ex-husband's Uncle Harvey, who refers to himself as the Local Forecast (he's a bit obsessed with the weather channel).  As Harvey keeps track of the weather heating up, things are heating up in Springfield.  Josie's pursuit of her obsession takes her down a dangerous path and Elaine's pursuit of salvation for Harvey threatens to take him down another dangerous path.  This story is told with much clever humor, with Josie's cynical observations on Springfield life being perhaps the most amusing.  I really enjoyed this novel and highly recommend it.	2002-01-20

It's the story of an American family, three sisters, one brother and their separated parents.  Each family member tells his or her story from his or her opinionated point of view.  Each story is both funny and sad and every one is well told.  The narrative starts with Viola, the family matriarch, who is recovering from a severe asthma attack and is in the hospital.  She goes on about all of her family members, including her estranged husband, alternatively picking out their faults and praising them.  One by one, each of them chimes in with their own story, but we eventually learn that Viola pretty much had them all pegged in the opening chapter.  We learn about family traumas, family squabbles.  Each character is likable and amusing, and each will face down a difficult challenge before this novel ends.  I truly enjoyed reading this one.  Have fun.	2002-01-12

The novel begins with the murder of a miniaturist in ancient Istanbul.  Before the murder is discovered, we meet Black, a young man who has returned to the city after traveling for 12 years.  He is still pining for Shekure, an old love who has since married another man, a man who is now missing.  Shekure's father is then murdered.  Black seeks to solve these murders and regain his lost love.  The novel takes place against a backdrop of conflict between traditionalist Muslim miniaturists and those who accept Western artistic expression.  This novel has been compared to works by Eco and Calvino.  I have to say that personally, I don't think My Name is Red rises to that level.  The novel, is good, very good, but ultimately falls a bit short of those works.  I found the pacing to be slow at times and I could not understand what made a lot of these miniaturists tick.  Still, My Name is Red is a very good novel that I recommend highly.	2001-12-30

He reunites with an old friend, Ozi, who has done very well for himself.  The differences between Ozi and Daru only serve to bring about Daru's fall sooner.  Daru's downward spiral occurs against a backdrop of heighted nuclear tension between Pakistan and India.  Things, and for Daru, it's mostly bad things, happen very quickly in this novel.  Daru tries to keep up appearances of being a success, but his deceptions quickly catch up with him.  His lack of wealth and power ultimately destroy him, on many levels.  I enjoyed Moth Smoke and found it to be an interesting novel and a very engaging read.	2001-12-30

That basic description may have you assuming that this novel would be a sweet, sentimental exploration of these three girls &quot;growing up.&quot;  I know that's what I thought it would be.  It's not.  All three young women face challenges that while completely believable, are not predictable or &quot;canned&quot; in any way.  Each one of them surprised me in several ways, and it is this element of subtle surprise that I think distinguishes this novel.  The characters are charming, without being corny;  the story is entertaining, without being predictable.  Enjoy.	2001-12-30

Many of his others, while I have enjoyed them, have put me off a little because the characters and/or the plot is a bit over the top, just too quirky for me.  Widow, while imaginative and entertaining, never gets to that too much stage.  It's a big novel, spanning about 40 years and has a satisfying, yet never hokey or corny ending.  The characters, of course, are a bit quirky in their way, but their quirkiness is somehow more believable than in other Irving novels.  The story is a lot of fun, and, because most of the characters are writers, allows Irving to explain and comment on the writing process.  I felt at some times he was answering his own critics while discussing the criticism of his character-writers.  He has fun with the whole thing, though, and never takes it too seriously, which is part of what makes this novel so enjoyable.  Widow is really a human story about loss and how far some of us will go for love.  Enjoy.	2001-12-24

Embers is a slim novel filled with human emotion and pain.  The novel begins with an old European aristocrat receiving a letter from a friend who the aristocrat then arranges to have brought to his estate for dinner.  It turns out that these two friends have not seen each other for 41 years.  Marai slowly unfolds the story of why and makes what could have been a mundane domestic drama into a compelling examination of guilt, anger, love and revenge.  The men confront each other as the aristocrat slowly reveals how he came to discover what his friend did to make him disappear from his life.  He talks on and on that evening, while the embers of the fire burn out, searching for answers to questions from his friend, questions that get to the heart of their relationship.  Embers is a well done, well written work.  Highly recommended.	2001-12-12

There are a lot of books out there like that, I know, but this one distinguishes itself from the pack.  Sara Gran is a fine writer and her novel holds together very well.  Mary, the protagonist is a likeable heroine dealing with real issues--such as her slightly troubled relationship with her mother, and her mother's failing health.  It is this relationship that is the focus of the novel and not the whole boyfriend thing that dominates so many other young single woman novels.  The novel is witty and well told.  Everything, plot, character, dialogue, is natural and unforced.  I really enjoyed this one.	2001-12-08

It's the story of a freshman at a huge state college who decides to major in art because he knows it will be mishandled in some mediocre way and for his first semester, it is.  He takes drawing from a woman whose artistic expertise and tastes even this 18 year old disdains.  The class, however, still has its merits.  He manages to befriend two diametrically opposed women who take his second semester art class--commercial (or maybe its graphic) arts.  The professor is borderline insane, as are many of the assignments.  Kidd does an excellent job of evoking the weirdness and the fun of college.  The ending of the novel is a little bizarre, and Kidd does manage to fill the book with much of what appears to be his own philosophy of art (its not forced, which is refreshing).  The novel is funny and clever and I really enjoyed it.  Well done.	2001-12-03

It's the story of New York, told from the underside.  Luc Sante has given us an excellently researched, excellently written work which explores the seedy side of New York, from about 1840 through 1920.  He lets us see how much New York City has changed, yet how much it has stayed the same.  The improvements to life in New York are remarkable, not so much for what they are, but for what they improved upon.  There is an almost uplifting message from this book:  New Yorkers can accomplish anything, can improve everything, can recover anytime.  If you know New York at all, or have any kind of interest in the city, I believe you will find this an engrossing, entertaining work.	2001-11-30

Naipaul is one of those writers with tremendous talent, so much so that even not his best work is still very well done.  He writes so much better than most writers, but the problem with Half a Life is that it really is not a very good showcase of his talents; it's not one of those books which I will remember months from now as being wonderful.  The messages won't linger for more than a few weeks.  I still think this is a well done work, compared to much of what else is available, it's just that coming from Naipaul, I found it a bit disappointing.	2001-11-28

The narrative was all caught up in this eerie, mystical mood thing that seemed very, very forced.  Then, about halfway through the novel, things picked up.  The ghost story aspect of it all was more natural and the story itself became engrossing.  The mystery of Miss Grange, or who the mother of the young heroine is actually got to be quite compelling.  I am not certain the ending compensated for the silliness of the first part of the novel, so I would advise to proceed with caution.	2001-11-27

I don't normally read spy thrillers, but the New York Times' review was so glowing, I couldn't resist.  I wasn't disappointed.  The Good German is part spy thriller, part love story, part historical fiction.  It is the story of Jack Geismar, a reporter, returning to post-WWII Berlin in search of the woman he loved before the war.  He finds much more than that.  An American soldier is murdered in the Russian controlled section of Berlin.  Something strikes Jack as simply not right in the story and he tries to get solve the riddle of the murder.  Kanon's exploration of Berlin focuses very well on the nuances and grey areas in war, and in particular WWII in Germany.  There really aren't many &quot;good&quot; Germans in this novel, just people who were trying to survuve any way they could.  Kanon is superb at bringing to light how the presence of the Nazi's clouded good and bad, so that good people did horrible things for seemingly &quot;good&quot; reasons.  Or were these good people, were they good reasons?  Kanon gives us no clear answer.  The Good German is satisfyingly thought provoking in that respect.  My few quibbles with the novel are the number of amazing coincidences (which may be standard in the spy thriller, I don't know) and at times the pacing gets a little bogged down.  Other than that, The Good German is an enjoyable, well done novel.	2001-11-26

And then, There are Truths	Books	5	8	8	N	N	One Man's Philisophical Journey	Transcend is a book that's hard to describe, or rather, hard to categorize.  It's part travelogue, part memoir, part philisophical rumination.  It's the kind of book I wish my professors had had me read in my freshman philosophy class, because it's real philosophy, written by a real person, someone who truly and earnestly believes in what he is saying, someone who wants to change the world and actually took action and wrote a book.  The first section of the book is a bit about Richard Joseph's life, his background and his travels through Asia and how he came to be traveling.  This part makes for enjoyable reading.  Joseph has an easy writing style that makes you feel like you are sitting having coffee or a beer with him, chatting with him, rather than reading.  Towards the end of the first part, a friend commits suicide, and this suicide sends Joseph into himself, sends him thinking.  The end product of these ruminations is the second half of the book.  Joseph tries to understand why there are so many inconsistencies in current society, inconsistencies rooted somehow in race, gender, wealth and power.  I cannot do his philosophy justice in a few sentences here.  I will say only read this book.  It is thoughtful, it will get you thinking.  As I said before, I wish I had read this my freshman year in college because I think it can foster many meaningful discussions and debates, all the while being completely readable, thoroughly engaging.  Joseph ponders and explores the underpinnings of our society.  Transcend will make you think.	2001-11-19

I truly enjoy Lodge's work, but I have to say, this isn't my favorite.  It's still terrific, but, in my opinion, not his strongest work.  It starts off a little slow and many of the characters, while funny, are a bit predictable.  I also think this novel didn't really stand the test of time.  That being said, it is a funny and engaging read, certain to make you chuckle and even laugh out loud.  It's just not Lodge's best work, but Lodge on a bad day is still infinitely better than most other writers on a good day.	2001-11-13

It's got a great, original, engaging story, told in a slightly different way than you would expect.  The plot takes many unexpected turns (all completely believable, however).  The novel starts off with Sophy Chase telling us about her sort of boyfriend.  They are both married to others (sort of) and it looks as if the novel will be the story about them.  It's not.  They are together at Sophy's, the phone rings and it's a state trooper telling Sophy that her husband was found dead.  She frantically returns to his island home, expecting one thing, finding another, over and over again.  The story is well written, well told, very enjoyable.  Life is unpredictable, as is Almost.

I recognize his faults (such as his at times thinly veiled misogynism), but I have always enjoyed every thing he has written.  For me, he works magic with the written word, but I realize that, like anything else, his work won't appeal to every reader.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed Gertrude and Claudius.  They have always been such unsympathetic characters--Shakespeare doesn't really delve into their psyches, so Updike does that for us.  We meet Gertude when she is about 16, about to be forced into marriage for purely political reasons.  She acquiesces and soon feels at least fondness, if not love for her husband.  They have a child (Hamlet, obviously), but she soon feels unsatisfied in her marriage and finds her answer in her brother in law.  Anyone familiar with Hamlet is familiar with that rather simple story.  Updike however, takes the ball and runs with it, giving us a novel with depth, humor, sex, lust and love.  We see Hamlet as the sulky, pain-in-the-neck teenager.  We see a much more human side of Gertrude and Claudius.  It's a lot of fun, I think, for a Shakespeare lover or a Updike lover.	2001-11-05

Most of these authors have achieved terrific success already (Helen Fielding, Zadie Smith, Dave Eggers, to name a few), but some are a little more obscure, but nonetheless, equally talented.

Christopher is sent back to England to live, where he grows up, with the mystery of his parents' disappearance constantly erodes his grip on reality.  The story is told in a first person narrative, and almost from the start, Ishiguro tips us off to the idea that Christopher may not be telling us the whole truth, that he may not be able to grasp the whole truth.  Christopher's story and the way he tells it is fascinating.  Ishiguro is able to navigate seamlessly from time frame to time frame.  Christopher achieves some notoriety in London (or at least he thinks he has) as a private investigator.  He returns after many years to Shanghai, to finally try and solve the mystery surrounding his parents' disappearance.  He believes he knows what happened to them, even before arriving back in Shangha.  It is his misguided beliefs that lead him into an almost Kafkaesque spiral into unreality and delusion.  This section of the book must be read as at least a partial deluded episode because much of what happens is implausible.  The book, and Christopher, ultimately return to reality and we understand at least part of the truth of Christopher's life and what happened to his parents.  I thought this was a brilliant work, not as a detective novel, but as a character study of someone who has been fooling himself his entire life.	2001-10-27

Then, sometimes, although this is rare, there is that fabulous quick read.  The one that is funny, with great characters and an engaging story, that doesn't make you feel empty after you have finished it.  The Wishbones falls in the latter category.  I loved this book.  It's about so many things I love to read about: music, relationships, New Jersey, fear of growing up, friends.  Tom Perrotta has given us a highly enjoyable story about Dave, a thiryone year old guitar player in a wedding band (he's got a day job, but it's nothing much).  Something happens to him one day which has him proposing to his longterm (15 years, on and off) girlfriend.  Then panic sets in.  Dave has never really grown up and the fear of marriage makes him do somethings he'll probably regret sooner or later (I have to admit, I was a little annoyed with him at times).  But the pieces of his life fall together and by the end of the novel, he realizes what is really important to him.  This is a satisfying and enjoyable read.  Have fun.	2001-10-20

It is two stories, really.  The first takes place in the &quot;present&quot; as it were, and is the story of an expedition to Tasmania, an expedition in search of the site of the Garden of Eden.  Three English passengers, all hilariously obnoxious in their own way, sail aboard a boat captained by a charmingly conniving Manxman who is always one step ahead of the customs men.  The other story takes place in the years leading up to the &quot;present&quot; in Tasmania.  In this story, the sinister, darker side of human nature is explored.  The English settlers there slowly, through disease, through murder, eliminate the natives there.  Both stories are on a pace to crash into each other.  You will spend a good part of this novel wondering what will happen when these two worlds collide.  The novel is told from many different viewpoints.  Each narrator thinks the world of him or herself, but exposes his or her flaws in mainly a comical fashion.  Kneale manages to keep a light tone throughout, while still exposing the ugly side of humanity, the greediness, the racism, the ugly imperialism.  A highly enjoyable work.	2001-10-16

Alice, the novel's young protagonist and her brother Boone suspect that their stepfather is trying to poison them.  This isn't the mere overactive imaginations of childhood, but a terribly unfortunate reality for these young teens.  As they escape from their home life, they discover some shocking truths about their stepfather.  The plot, while not predictible, isn't exactly groundbreaking, but the story is engaging and I found Alice to be very likable.  She's funny and smart and never lets her fear get the best of her.

Her mother dies shortly after she is born and she is raised by her aunt and father.  She grows up in a small Scottish town and eventually moves away to study nursing and falls in love.  Eva's story, however, is not ordinary for two important reasons.  First, she is visited, at a very young age, by her &quot;companions&quot;, two ghosts who come in and out of her life, helping, interfering, meddling.  Second, the story is told by Margot Livesey who is quite an extraordinary storyteller.  She breaths life into this &quot;ghost&quot; story so that it is interesting, moving and subtly emotional.  Eva is as surprised by these ghosts as we are and her narration is wonderfully understated.  I truly loved this novel.  There was something almost comforting about reading it.  While it is a story about Eva's life, it is also the story of the love we have for our families and how absolutely powerful that love is.  The final pages moved me to tears without a scintilla of sentimentality.  Ms. Livesey is truly talented.  I recently finished The Missing World, and, while I loved both novels, each is completely different.  Enjoy this one.	2001-10-08

I needed such a book about now, and Big Stone Gap certainly met that need.  Big Stone Gap is the story of Ave Maria Mulligan, a 34-year old single pharmacist, who, despite her many protests, is really looking for love.  She lives in Big Stone Gap, a small Virginia mining town filled with wonderfully  charming characters with big hearts.  I will admit, I am not usually a fan of this type of novel, the oh what a wacky southern town we live in genre, but Big Stone Gap doesn't go over the top as many others do.  The characters stay on the right side of reasonable and Ave Maria is a wonderful heroine.  She narrates the novel, which may make the difference.  It could just be that I am a sucker for a good love story, but I found Big Stone Gap to be quite enjoyable, if not &quot;great literature&quot;.  At times, it gets a little hokey, but again, not overmuch.  It's a breezy novel that I think most will enjoy.	2001-10-03

The Corrections focuses on an average American family--average in that they are like no other, yet with hopes, dreams, flaws and foibles like so many others.  The Lambert's are kind of a mess.  Alfred, the family patriarch, suffers from Parkinson's, and his wife, Enid, is in denial about the nature of his suffering, as well as many other details about her family.  She is trying desperately to have &quot;one last Christmas&quot; at the family home in the midwest, trying to convince her three grown children to leave the East coast where they now live to let her have this one dream.  Good luck Enid getting them all together.  Her youngest, Denise is the only one who agrees to come.  Denise perhaps has to escape the mess she has made of her life in Philadelphia.  Chip, the middle child, has left New York, after being fired from his cushy academic position for sexual harassment, and is somewhere in Eastern Europe perpetrating securities fraud on an unsuspecting American public.  And Gary, well Gary's wife doesn't see the point of dragging their three boys out there because she cannot get along with her mother-in-law.  Franzen explores this family through their various viewpoints.  We see their struggles, their despair, their happiness, narrated with an ironic wit that makes The Corrections a terrific read.  The Corrections is a big, long, enjoyable novel (that maybe could have used some editing, but there are only a couple passages I could see taking out).  It's funny, it's sarcastic, it's amusing.  (and, it's not your typical Oprah selection, if that's scaring you away; it's got much more edge).  Have fun with this one.	2001-09-28

It should be obvious to readers of the reviews on these pages, though, that this novel is not for everyone and it's not for everyone because of that part of it that is something all its own.  Eliza Naumann is a shy, unremarkable girl, treated as nothing special even by her own family. It isn't until she wins the area spelling bee and is off to the nationals that she finally gets some attention from her cerebral father.  Her mother is another story, another plot line.  From the moment Miriam, Eliza's mother, is introduced, there is something simply not right with her one of Goldberg's threads in this novel explores what's inside Miriam's head.  We also meet Eliza's brother Aaron, who, because Eliza has displaced him from the child of honor in the household, goes off on a spiritual quest of his own.  Things are not what they seem in this novel, there is much brewing in this seemingly simple suburban family.  Saul, the father sees Eliza's spelling talent as a sign of her inner mysticism, but he focuses so on her, that the other members of his family, who sorely, sorely need him are neglected to the point of breakdown.  There are no easy resolutions to their problems and the novel does not end with loose ends tied up neatly, the problems continue.  The mysticism element of the novel may strike some as odd.  Perhaps these factors are why many have disliked the novel.  If you feel up to it, though, read this novel.  Bee Season is a marvelous novel written by a talented young writer.  Myla Goldberg's writing is beautiful,  her characters are real.  Yes, the story does take some interesting twists, nothing predictable, but still nothing that comes &quot;out of the blue.&quot;  Enjoy	2001-09-10

Hazel has been hit by a car and is beset by a series of seizures.  Her memory of the last three years has vanished and, because of the seizures, in walks Jonathan, an old lover, who by virtue of Hazel's memory loss, Hazel believes to be her current lover.  He takes complete advantage of the memory loss and little by little, Livesey reveals what it is exactly that Hazel has forgotten.  Let's just leave it at Jonathan is not a very nice person.  At the beginning of the novel, Livesey also introduces two other characters who have yet to meet Hazel, but who ultimately play an important role in Hazel's life with Jonathan--Freddie, an American expatriate roofer in search of someone to love and someone to save and Charlotte, an unemployed actress in search of somewhere to live.  Livesey ultimately brings all three lives together in a fascinating way.  The Missing World is a well told story that will keep you wondering how it will turn out.  Enjoy	2001-09-07

The novel follows three women in contemporary LA.  Mina works at Lorene's upscale, super successful restaurants, is having affairs with two men and is perpetually late because she won't ride in cars any more.  Lorene has her own issues, trying to find some sort of satisfaction through new age remedies like spiritual exfoliation.  Lisa cleans Lorene's house, trying to scrape by and support her five year old twins and survive her marginally successful marriage.  Lisa is the only &quot;real&quot; character in the novel, although Mina and Lorene certainly are believable.  Their successes and LA have removed them from what is real, from what Lisa's struggles are all about.  The disjointedness in the novel only highlights the disjointedness of  Mina and Lorene's life.  The writing is marvelous in this novel; it's quick-witted and entertaining, while also being thought-provoking.  There are many layers in Lightning Field, enjoy discovering them.	2001-09-06

The Rich Part of Life is full of unique characters, with a wonderful story.  When Teddy Pappas' father wins almost $200 million in the lottery, Teddy anticipates that his life will change dramatically.  It does, but not in the way he thinks it will.  The plot takes many unpredictable turns and has some really hilarious scenes narrated with a deadpan humor from 11 year old Teddy.  His observations bring out the notion of how money changes everything, essentially not for the better.  Teddy learns to appreciate how lucky he is and how truly rich his life is by the end of the novel, and it's not based on the money.  Kokoris accomplishes this with no sentimentality or melodrama, just fine storytelling.  Enjoy	2001-09-05

Track down a used copy of Hunger Point, it will be worth your effort.  Hunger Point is a very funny, engaging story, with many more layers than the usual single girl in search of life, love and career.  Frannie Hunter the protagonist has always been overshadowed by her brilliant younger sister Shelly.  Frannie had just moved back home and is working as a waitress in a local restaurant and is single, but Shelly has just been hospitalized for anorexia.  As their family tries to cope with Shelly's crisis, Frannie tries to deal with her own issues, on top of what's happening to Shelly.  Hunger Point can be funny and sad at the same time.  It is a wonderful exploration of family relationships and of eating disorders.  Frannie is a warm, personable character you will find yourself rooting for.  Find yourself a copy and enjoy.	2001-09-04

It's not your typical novel, because nothing really happens, there is no plot to speak of.  It will, however, make you think.  Think about the nature of identity and what makes us who we are.  The Body Artist is really more of a parable than a novel.  The two main characters--Lauren, a &quot;body artist&quot; who turns her own body into nothingness, a blank sheet and an odd man who she discovers living in her home who can do perfectly uncanny imitations of other people's voices, but has no voice of his own--are interesting in their bizarre similarities.  But nothing really happens to them.  But still, DeLillo is DeLillo and he writes marvelously.  If you are in the mood for something experimental, give this one a try.	2001-09-03

Marie is trying to put together an obituary to end all obituaries about Nora, and as she goes about her research, she learns some interesting truths about Nora, about herself and her brother.

It's not. A Perfect Arrangement is an excellent novel, about a family that looks perfect from the outside, but is actually crumbling on the inside. Mirella and Howard, husband and wife, are actually keeping horrible secrets from one another--before the so-called perfect nanny starts watching their children. Randi, the nanny, has her own problems, as do the children. A story like this could easily fall into overdone melodrama, but Berne carries it off very, very successfully. The characters, flaws and all, are completely believable. The plot is surprising without ever being over the top. The dialogue is true and flows naturally and while this is a serious novel, it is not without touches of humor. All in all, A Perfect Arrangement is an excellent, well done novel that I highly recommend.	2001-09-01

The premise is a good one--young divorced woman in New York, searching for career, goes into real estate and meets many wacky people in her search for life and love. As I was reading the novel, however, I got the sense that it was almost a first draft. It could have been funnier, Belle could have made me care more for the protagonist. Still, this is an entertaining and quick read, just not smart and snappy enough for my taste.	2001-08-31

The novel is really a look at suburban life in it's most unflattering light. I enjoyed the novel--it can be very funny and on target at times. It reminded me a bit of American Beauty in that both satirically strip all the sugarcoating off of suburban life. The novel is just one side of suburbia, and if you don't mind a little sarcasm and satire, I highly recommend this novel.	2001-08-30

What a helpful resource this book is. It explains what seizures are, clearly, for the nonscientist, and then goes on to explain how a diagnosis is arived at. The book continues with advice on living with a partial seizure disorder, dealing with school, jobs, etc., and what kinds of treatments (medical and less traditional) there are available. There is not a wasted page in this book. All of the information is valuable and helpful. If you need a book to help you understand partial seizure disorders, this book will satisfy most every need.	2001-08-29

These are contemplative stories and because they all deal with similar underlying topics (but altogether different stories)--the return to the rural, the countryside's slow adaptation to change, youth contrasted with age--it makes sense to read these stories slowly, over several weeks. I believe reading these quickly may cause them to blend together, something you don't want to do because each story has its unique original beauty. MacLeod writes very carefully and his prose is very, I don't know, almost heavy, very powerful. You have to be in a contemplative mood, I believe, to appreciate these stories. This is not a collection for that cross country plane ride, or your week at the beach. Rather, these are stories to be savored slowly, in peace and quiet. Well done.	2001-08-28

Perhaps when the story begins with the two lovers dead bodies lying in the dunes. Jim Crace's Being Dead is a magnificent tale told in an unconventional way. Instead of telling the story of Joseph and Felice starting with how they met, got married, had kids, grew old, etc., Crace chooses to start with their demise. From there, the narrative develops in many different directions. Most disturbingly, perhaps, is how their bodies decay on the beach after their murder. He also tells the story of how they met years earlier, not far from where there bodies lie. Another story works backwards, very slowly, on the day they met their demise. And finally, there is the story of their daughter, as she slowly discovers what has happened to her parents. These four intertwined narratives reveal much about Joseph and Felice, perhaps more than would the traditional &quot;love story.&quot; Being Dead is inventive, creative, and a pleasure to read, but it is not, not, not for the faint of heart. The description of the bodies' decay is very graphic and some would find it disturbing. There is of course nothing gratuitous and I found the descriptions to be so well done, so elegantly crafted, to be almost a pleasure to read. If you think you have the stomach for that, I highly recommend this novel. Very well done.	2001-08-16

It's completely hilarious, in the Bridget Jones, Getting Over It, laugh out loud vein and (here's the best part) it's not about a single woman.  Clara, our heroine, is married, with two boys and wondering, am I happy?, is this all there is?, etc.  Clara is extremely funny and makes us laugh at all the things we moms of young children chuckle about anyway (you know, those other moms who have it all together, how do they do it?, the unsupportive husband vis-a-vis parenting, etc.).  Clara is an extremely likable narrator, trying to be a good wife and mother and keeping us amused all the way. But what does it mean, My Life On a Plate?  One day, Clara looks down at a meal she is about to eat.  It's a little congealed, not really that appetizing, when it really should be exciting her.  She realizes, that's it, it's her life on a plate, shouldn't she be a little more excited about her life, shouldn't it be more appetizing?  Those are the questions that bother her throughout the novel as she goes about being wife, mother, friend, daughter.  I really enjoyed this one.  I have been in search of something completely hilarious for months and have finally found it.  The characters and dialogue are very funny and it is a truly enjoyable read.  Have fun with this one.	2001-08-14

If you fall into one of those two categories, you've got to read this novel.  If you are new to both, it's probably a better idea to start somewhere else, like Rachel's Holiday, which is my favorite Keyes' novel.  Last Chance Saloon is an interesting story with a unique premise.  Three old friends from Ireland, Katherine, Tara and Fintan, are living the high life in London.  One is in a successful, long term relationship, one is in a dead end relationship with a partner who will never be ultimately satisfying, and one is terrified of relationships and avoids them like the plague.  When the first gets seriously ill and extracts promises from the other two to fix their respective romantic lives, the story starts to get very interesting.  But, it takes half the novel to get there, so you have to be very patient.  Last Chance Saloon is certainly humorous, but it's not as hilariously funny as Keyes' other novels, perhaps because she has made the switch from first person narrator to omniscient narrator.  Still, to me, a Marian Keyes novel is always a lot of fun, and Last Chance Saloon is no exception.  Enjoy.	2001-08-10

I encourage all to overcome the intimidating fact that the novel is about the plague and diver right in to the work.  Year of Wonders is an intelligent, engaging, emotional read--very well done indeed.  Anna Firth is a survivor, in many ways.  She survives the plague which utterly decimates her village.  When the plague arrives, she has already lived through much.  Her father abused her and her husband has died in a mining accident, left her a widow with two young children, at the ripe age of 18.  As disease rips through her village, Anna works with the minister's wife, trying to provide some solace, some comfort to the rest of the village.  The plague is not the only killer in these times for several townspeople are killed by hatred, jealousy and prejudice.  The plague ultimately leaves the village and Anna is a changed person, which sounds trite, I know, but in the novel, it's not.  This novel is so fabulous, Anna's emotions so real.  There were parts of this novel that literally had me in tears.  I highly, highly recommend this novel.  It is a wonderful and most enjoyable read.	2001-08-06

I think the best advice for a reader of this novel is to forget that High Fidelity exists and enjoy the novel for what it is--an exploration into the rationalizations that may have so permeated our lives that we have smugly concluded that we are &quot;good&quot; despite other evidence to the contrary.  (Frankly, I find it commendable that Hornby hasn't wasted his talents trying to recreate his first novel, but has branched out.)  Anyway, How to be Good is the story of Katie Carr, a London doctor and her crumbling marriage.  Katie thinks she's a good person, mainly because she is a doctor, and she constantly keeps reminding us of that, probably because deep down inside, she doesn't really believe it.  She's really not all that good, when you get down to it.  She's cheating on her husband and in the opening chapter of the novel, tells him she wants a divorce over the phone.  Her husband is not the easiest to live with, not very &quot;nice&quot; in the polite sense of the word.  She wishes he would change, thinking that somehow, that would make it all better, but when he does change, she still doesn't like him much. He, too tries to be good, but in a different fashion and the juxtaposition of those two approaches makes for intersting reading. <br />One of the most interesting things about the novel is how effectively Hornby navigates the inner workings of Katie's rationalizations, how she gets through the day, justifying what she does, still defending herself as a good person.  It's a thought-provoking exploration of what it means to be good in today's modern world, if it's possible at all, without giving up all you have.  It's a humorous (but not hilarious) look at human foibles, and actually might make you feel a bit uncomfortable if you see your own rationalizations in Katie's life.	2001-08-04

For some reason, I thought Girl Talk would be a light, fluffy humorous look at mother-daughter relationships, but it's not; Girl Talk is a look back on a pivotal summer, what she calls the summer that wasn't, in a young girl's life.  The Girl Talk she has with her mother is not superficial, but rather covers the truth which is so often hidden between mothers and daughters.  <br />The novel opens in the present, with Lissy (the young woman) 30 and pregnant with her married ex-lover's child.  She reflects back on that summer fifteen years ago, when she and her mother flee their New Hampshire town for her mom's hometown of Bayonne, New Jersey in the hopes that it provides some guidance for what to do now.  She tells us the stories of her mother's life that her mother told her, maybe they will provide her with an answer.  All three stories, Lissy's current story, her mother's and their joint story fifteen years ago, are told in wonderful &quot;girl talk&quot;, full of witty, wise and wisecracking observations.  In Lissy's summer, fifteen years ago, girl talk with her mother helps her to learn that her mother is human, that her mother had a life before.<br />This novel reminded me very much of three other novels that I love:  Anywhere but Here, Welcome to my Planet and Otherwise Engaged.  Lissy's voice is wise beyond her years, sarcastic and observant.  Enjoy.	2001-08-04

Barbara Ehrenreich decided to see if she could live for three months as an &quot;unskilled&quot; worker in three different locations, Florida, Maine and Minnesota.  Her experiences are fascinating and engrossing mainly because she did the whole nine yards.  Could she survive at the jobs she could get with no skills, and still be able to find a decent place to live and eat.  The answer is, it's really difficult on all fronts.  The jobs she had were difficult and physically exhausting, but even more difficult were her housing problems, which was something I wasn't expecting, but it's not that surprising if you think about it.  The housing problems also gave way to her eating crisis.  If the one room you live in has no refrigerator, it's very difficult to eat frugally and heathily.  Ehrenreich's experiences are so difficult and you feel her relief when she returns to her &quot;normal&quot; life, but that leaves us with the problem of the rest of the Americans for whom Ehrenreich's experiment is their life.  Her story is engrossing and interesting and told with much warmth and humor.  She reflects on where we go from here at the end of the book (although some of her observations about the difficulty of working could apply to any industry at any income level), which hopefully some Washington policy makers will reflect on.  Nickel and Dimed is an engaging read, an important read.  It does not provide a big sweeping solution to solving the crisis of the low wage working people of America, but what it does is bring the life that crisis, so those who think it does not exist, can no longer deny that something should be done.	2001-08-01

Sheri Holman has given us a fascinating study of the weakness of the human heart, of human health.  Set in cholera stricken England, The Dress Lodger is an interesting and engaging tale Gustine, a young woman forced to be a &quot;dress lodger&quot;, who, in exchange for rent and the care of her frail, newborn child, wears an expensive dress and acts as an &quot;escort&quot; of sorts.  She meets Henry Chiver, a doctor running from his past, and hopes that he may help her sick child, but Chiver has his own agenda, first seeking dead bodies as his salvation, and then the live one of Gustine's son.  The Dress Lodger is an excellent work of historical fiction, filled with believable characters and their heartbreaking characters.  The story is wonderful too, full of twists and minus any saccharine happy ending.  Enjoy.	2001-07-29

Most woman would call him a pig, but that's only because he's letting us in on his innermost thoughts.  I guess he's an honest pig.  Harry and his roommate, Gerrard, both have this ideal perfect woman in their mind.  It sounds like they have dated nice, but not perfect women in the past, thus the relationships end.  Then they meet Alice and she is perfect, gorgeous and for some reason, likes both of them. They battle it out for her attentions, and one of them eventually wins.  As I said before, this book is very funny and will make you laugh out loud.  My only complaint is that sometimes, Barrowcliffe goes off on these humorous tangents which sometimes detract from the narrative tension.  You'll just be getting into a scene, and he'll start describing a pile of garbage, very funny, but not entirely necessary.  Otherwise, I really enjoyed this very funny novel.  Have fun.	2001-07-28

Carrere imaginatively explores the dark side of the human mind, what our mind can do to us, in an interesting way.  These stories are short, but they pack an emotional punch that you won't soon forget.  Class Trip is about a young, hyperimaginative, lonely boy on a class skiing trip when something goes horribly wrong and the real world unfortunately catches up with the horrible world of his imagination.  The Mustache is about a man who shaves off his mustache, only to have everyone he knows, including his wife, deny that it ever existed.  Other bits of his world start vanishing without a trace and there is a clever ending.  Both of these works are intriguing, eerie and fascinating.  I would recommend them to anyone who wants a little sophisticated horror.	2001-07-25

Jane Green's tale of a young woman in search of love in London (yes, we've read these before, but that doesn't take away from the fun) is amusing and entertaining.  Libby, our heroine, meets Nick, a hunky commitmentphobe.  They think they will have a little fling, but somehow, start to fall in love....  Nick really wasn't Mr. Right anyway, too poor, yucky friends, etc.  So Libby hooks up with one of the wealthiest eligible bachelors around.  Now there's Mr. Right, right?  OK, not the most original plot, but the characters are a lot of fun.  Libby talks to you as if you are her best friend, which makes the novel an enjoyable, breezy read.  The supporting cast are all believable and no subplot takes away from the story at hand.  If you are looking for some fun summer reading, look no more.  This one is loads of fun.  Enjoy	2001-07-21

The narrator, Ellen is telling her story to her daughter from some future vantage point.  Right from the beginning, Walbert lets us know that things aren't always as Ellen remembers them.  Ellen is telling the story of when she first met her cousin Randall, and how the Oak trees lined the drive.  But then, just a few paragraphs later, she thinks perhaps it may have been walnut trees.  Most of the shifting memories are not as obvious and not as harmless as that.  Her story involves her relationship with two men--Randall, her cousin whow is killed in World War II, and Henry Rock, a young army officer she meets just before he goes to the Korean War.  Her relationship with these two men and the devastations of the wars upon all of them shape her life irrevocably.  Her memory plays tricks on her, plays tricks on us.  She hides bits of the story from us, until these facts surface in shocking ways.  It is as if she doesn't want her daughter (and us) to know the truth until we absolutely have to.  The gardens of Kyoto serve as a wonderful metaphor for what remains after a war, for obvious illusions.  Ellen is like the gardens, or is she?  While the gardens were specifically spared in wars, as was Ellen, Ellen's life is ultimately changed for the worse as a result of these wars.  The story Ellen tells, the ghosts who haunt her life, provide us with a fascinating tale that I highly recommend.	2001-07-16

That does not mean that this book isn't a great resource for me.  Kurcinka discusses a multitude of different behavior problems and gives helpful suggestions for each personality type.  Each chapter has a one page summary at the end, which proves to be a useful review after reading the book, when you need a refresher to deal with a particular situation.  I know that I will turn to this book again and again for help with my child.  Thank you Ms. Kurcinka	2001-07-12

It's 1902 in Loring Mississippi.  Tandy Payne has returned to his hometown after running out of money to find that his brother Leighton, editor of the local newspaper, has become mayor of the town.  Tandy figures he can use his brother's position to get a job so that he can reclaim the family plantation.  He decides that the job for him is postmaster because the current postmistress is a black woman, and he believes that the incipient racism in the town, which he incites, will support his quest. She resigns under pressure, but the president gets involved, seeking to reinstate her.  The story is not pretty, but the telling is beautiful.  Yarbrough is a fine writer, and while some of his characters are pure evil, most are caught somewhere between good and evil.  The situation is difficult, with many people caught between doing what is right, and doing what will help them survive.  Visible Spirits is a great American story.  Enjoy.	2001-07-10

It's full of real characters living real, and depressing, lives.  The novel is not completely without hope and it is not a depressing read, mainly because of Rickstad's talented storytelling.  What makes Reap so interesting is not so much the story, but the telling of the story.  The novel centers around Jessup, a young fatherless teenage boy, spending his summer just drifting around, fishing, riding his bike, until he meets up with Reg, a recent ex-con with a crop of marijuana he wants to protect, and many enemies.  Rickstad explores the lives of his characters and brings them to life.  His depiction of their lives rings true, there is no sugarcoating, there is no contrived happy ending.  Just talented writing, wonderful storytelling.	2001-07-09

The twist is that there is a plausible story with strong characters. The emphasis in P.S. is much more on romance (or more like lust, love and sex) than on comedy, although it is very funny at times, and always told with humor. Louise has never truly gotten over her first love, Scott Feinstadt, who died in a car accident at 19 a few weeks after breaking up with her (for her best friend). Louise carried on, eventually marrying one of her professors ten years her senior. The marriage ultimately fell apart, but they remained very good friends, very close. Louise drifted along, never realizing the depths of her unhappiness until one day, she comes across F. Scott Feinstadt, a 24 year old man with a more than uncanny resemblance to that first love. Her best friend swings back into the picture, the exhusband gets involved, and Louise discovers some uncomfortable things about the life she has led so far.<br />While this has all the elements of a standard romantic comedy--unmarried woman, old relationship, new relationship, stumbling blocks in the way--it is much, much better than most. The story is very clever, with nothing outlandish or fairy tale like. It's also a little thought provoking. Schulman ruminates on the nature of relationships and loneliness, of how one can be married, yet still be totally alone. I really enjoyed this one and highly recommend it.	2001-07-09

I am not one of them.  While the story may have had some potential, Picoult doesn't develop anything.  There is nothing special about this novel at all, it's just a run-of-the-mill story.  No humor, no character development, no believable characters, no thought-provoking observations, nothing to distinguish it as anything but a quick read.  She skims the surface, gives us predictable and somewhat boring and indistinguishable characters.  As a quick read, it's not awful, but that's about the best I can say.	2001-07-02

Murakami gives us much in a little over 200 pages; the story is wonderful on so many different levels.  On the surface it is the story of a young Japanes woman, Sumire, who falls in love with an older woman, Mui, who becomes her boss.  The story is narrated by K, a young man who loves Sumire.  No love in the novel is requited.  Sumire and Mui travel through Europe and K eventually travels to Greece to help find Sumire when she vanishes.  The novel here, however, is much more than the plot.  It is a rumination on modern loneliness and isolation, filled with thoughts and ideas on what it is to write fiction, to read fiction, to live fiction.  Sputnik Sweetheart is also interesting in that it is narrated by K, although the story is really Sumire's, a frustrated novelist.  I thoroughly enjoyed Sputnik Sweetheart and highly recommend it.	2001-06-30

I have never been a huge fan of Anne Tyler, but I've always felt almost obligated to read her novels, they are almost ubiquitous.  Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this novel.  There were some minor things that bothered me, which I will discuss later, but all in all, this novel is an enjoyable and quick read, which I found rather thought-provoking.  Because of that thought-provoking nature of the novel, I believe it would make an excellent book club selection; there really is a lot to chew on and discuss in this novel.  Rebecca, the 53 year old protagonist, wonders how she ended up as she did after a particularly bad day with her extended family.  Her thoughts send her in pursuit of the life that she could have had, if she had not married as she did when she was 20.  She married a divorced man, 13 years her senior, with three young daughters and a family business to run.  He died several years later and she essentially took over his life, raising his daughters (and one of her own), looking after his elderly uncle, and running the family business, which is hosting parties and events.  33 years later, she wonders, did she make the right choice, was this where she was &quot;supposed&quot; to be?  The novel answers that question in a very satisfying, non-simplistic, non-formulaic manner.  The novel is honest, and based in reality which I found refreshing and enjoyable.  Rebecca is a likeable protagonist, yet not perfect.  There were times in the novel when I just wanted to shake her, but most of the time she's a level headed, mature woman.<br />The only thing about the novel that I take issue with are the characters of the four daughters.  They were so annoying selfish, that I felt it was a little over the top. But other than that minor flaw, a very well done, enjoyable novel.	2001-06-28

What it is is an exploration on the nature of life and death, it's about growing old in a country obsessed with the young.  The narrator of this monologue is David Kepesh, a 70ish professor reflecting on an affair he had with one of his much younger students several years earlier.  Something has happened, which we discover towards the end of the work, which has put him in a particularly pensive and reflective mood.  He talks on about his affair and other events in his life.  He's not a particularly likeable person, some would consider what he does despicable and sexist, yet what he has to say is compelling.  I don't think I could have taken 500 pages of the Dying Animal, but 156 seems about right.  What Kepesh has to say is thoughtful and thought-provoking, and the point of his monologue becomes clear as the work draws to a close.  The Dying Animal clearly isn't for the faint of heart, the easily offended.  If you can handle a thought-provoking exposition with apologies to no one, give this one a try.	2001-06-25

Imagine you are Cannie, a slightly overweight young woman who has just broken up with her boyfriend of three years.  You open up a Glamour-Cosmopolitan type magazine to discover that your ex has a new column, &quot;Good in Bed&quot; and he has chosen to write about &quot;Loving a Larger Woman.&quot;  That's what happened to Cannie one morning, and it sends her off on a sort of voyage of rediscovery.  We follow Cannie as she tries to come to terms with her weight issues, boyfriend issues, family issues and career issues.  Her story is entertaining and humorous (not, though, laugh out loud funny like Bridget Jones or Getting Over It).  The first half of the novel is grounded in realism and then about halfway through, the fairy tale kicks in.  I enjoyed this book, particularly because as a romantic comedy, it wasn't obvious until well into the novel what guy she was going to end up with when it was all over.  Jennifer Weiner writes well and has given us a wonderful protagonist in Cannie.	2001-06-23

The story is not too taxing and the reading is easy.  Vianne Rocher and her young daughter move into a small provincial French town and open a chocolate shop during Lent.  The village priest takes great offense at that and tries in his own way to shut her down.  Vianne befriends the various misfits from town, enriching their lives through her friendship and her chocolate.  The novel is too light to be taken as deep symbolism, but rather is a fairy tale/morality play in which traditional roles are switched.  The Catholic Church, instead of providing salvation, is all emptiness, while the chocolatier asks people to reexamine their lives and in some instances, saves them.  If you tend to get offended by writers poking a little fun at the Catholic Church, this novel will probably offend you.  But if you are looking for a light, enjoyable well-written read which turns expectations upside down, try a little Chocolat.  You won't be disappointed.	2001-06-23

This is a great companion for anyone with an interest in weight training, and once you read what he has to say, you will realize you must weight train.  I had been stuck in a circuit rut at my gym, always too intimidated to figure out how the other machines worked.  I got this book and it changed everything.  He's got twelve weeks of workouts planned, three days a week.  Every exercise is explained thoroughly, complete with pictures and pointers on common mistakes.  The workouts are also great.  They will keep you interested in your program and feeling great afterwards.  The book is a paperback spiral, so it is perfect to bring to the gym and refer to during your workout.  I highly recommend this book for everyone with an interest in weight training.  It makes working out simple, yet challenging.	2001-06-23

Does the novel live up to the hype.  Yes, yes, definitely yes.  There is so much to rave about in this novel.  Whitehead writes like a dream.  Each sentence is a work of art, and those sentences add up to a great story filled with uniquely believable characters, witty dialog and observations and an interesting story.  J. Sutter is a journalist, a junketeer, taking up every invitation he receives to attend a free conference to cover whatever needs coverage.  This time, it is John Henry Days, the celebration of a new postage stamp, in a West Virginia town where John Henry's legend is said to originate.  The world and his job are beating J. down, just as John Henry's world and his job beat him down.  But this time, it's not as obvious as grueling physical labor, instead it's the day to day grind of the junketeer's life.  Whereas John Henry's world was obviously killing him, J.'s world is much more subtle.  But J. has hope, whereas, we'll never know whether the legendary John Henry did.  The novel juxtaposes tragedy with humor, bittersweet sadness with hopeful optimism.  It embraces much of what it is to be American, as seen from J.'s perspective.  All in all, a well told tale with much to recommend.	2001-06-20

Rides of the Midway is a delightfullly entertaining novel which I must admit surprised me.  For some reason, I was expecting something different, something more along the lines of what I expect to be &quot;Southern&quot; fiction.  In Rides of the Midway, the focus is primarily on Noel Weatherspoon as he grows up, and not on the place he grows up in.  The turning point in his life comes when he slides into home plate during a peewee baseball game, trying to stretch a triple into a home run.  He crashes into the catcher, who is later hospitalized in an irreversible coma brought on by a pre-existing condition.  Sounds serious, but it really isn't.  The young boy's ghost, and many others, periodically haunt Noel.  He sleep walks, can't live without his asthma puffer, discovers girls, photography, sex, drugs, all with a sort of bemused disassociation that is endearing.  Durkee captures the surrealistic quality of growing up.  I am sure we can all remember incidents when we said to ourselves &quot;What am I doing here?&quot;  That's the essence of Noel's life.  He is a likeable protagonist and this is an enjoyable novel.  Have fun.	2001-06-13

Not too challenging or mindboggling, just an imaginative story that I think most people will enjoy.  Tracy Chevalier has come up with an interesting concept--she takes an enigmatic Vermeer painting--The Girl with a Pearl Earring--and weaves an interesting and well-written story about it.  Griet is a young woman whose family's financial luck has changed after an accident leaves her artisan father blind.  She is hired as a teenage girl to work in the Vermeer household as a maid and soon, because of her own artistic sensibilities begins secretly assisting the artist.  Griet ultimately models for the famous painting, and the conflict it causes is her story.  There are many other stories swirling around Griet, those of her own family, the Vermeer family and Peter, a young man she meets at the market.  I found this an interesting read, perfect for a warm summer's day, when you are searching for something a little more substantial than the usual summer fodder.  Enjoy.	2001-06-09

Empire Falls is a wonderful novel, brilliantly crafted, yet completely readable.  I have always enjoyed his work, but for some reason, I found this one even better than his other novels (which are terrific in their own right).  The novel tells the story of Empire Falls, a Maine town that has seen better, much better days, and the people who inhabit it, primarily, Miles Roby, a fortyish man who himself has seen better days.  Both Miles and the town of Empire Falls had shown much promise, but things changed.  For the town, it was the closing of the textile factories about twenty years earlier.  For Miles, it was his return to the town from college, one semester short of his degree.  Miles now runs the Empire Diner under the thumb of Mrs. Whiting, a wealthy old woman who apparently owns most of the town.  His marriage is almost over, his ex-wife soon to marry the local health club owner.  He is trying to salvage his relationship with his teenage daughter, Tick, and save the restaurant he has been managing from financial ruin.  He and all the other residents in the town keep trying to get their life back together, trying to find that promise that they all felt their lives once held, back when the mills were still working.  What may sound like a depressing tale, actually never is, because the hope really is there and the story is told with much wonderful humor.  Most of the characters, and their relationships with each other are funny, not in the Bridget Jones sort of way, but in an everyday sort of way.  Miles' ex-wife, Janine, comes up with a funny, yet somehow sad, future of the lives of the Empire Falls High School football players and cheerleaders as she watches the big game from the stands that is devastatingly accurate, but funny just the same.<br />Empire Falls is truly a fantastic novel.  Very highly recommended.	2001-06-09

To me, the obvious choice was Little House in the Big Woods, a book I associate with my own mother reading to me.  This book was a fabulous choice.  My daughter and I both looked forward to reading a chapter or two each night.  This book sparked her interest in a time long ago, she is now constantly wondering if Laura and Mary had faucets and if they had Barbies.  She has learned to appreciate what we have now, while also appreciating the beauty and joy of a simpler life.  Laura and Mary are excellent role models for her.  While they are children with spirit, they also mind their parents.  This book has given her imagination a boost too for we all now pretend to be the Ingalls family.  I highly recommend this book (and the rest of the series) to all parents of young children.  It is perfect read aloud material for it holds a great story, with many moral lessons for our children.	2001-05-31

If The Thirteen-Gun Salute is your first encounter with the series, good choice (but, actually, they are all good).  For those new to the series, the first chapter serves as an excellent summary of what has already transpired, and for those returning, it's a good review, in case you forgot something. The novel contains the usual entertaining mix of espionage, naval history, human relationships, food, music and humor.  As expected, The Thirteen-Gun Salute is a completely enjoyable work by a talented author.  Enjoy.	2001-05-31

If you read this book to the end, you'll never eat fast food again.  I know I won't.  Eric Schlosser's book is an impressive dissection of the fast food industry in the United States, one that unflinchingly examines each aspect of that industry. The result is an unflattering picture of an industry that has changed US business and eating habits in an almost secretive fashion.  The book is fascinating, comprehensively critiquing hiring, franchising, purchasing and other practices.  The most fascinating, and indeed the most disturbing chapters concern, however, the beef served at fast food restaurants and how it gets there.  I warn you now, it is not a pretty picture.  If you care about the food you eat, these chapters will sicken you.  But if you care about the food you eat, you must read this book (unless you never eat fast food at all). The food quality aside, this book is very, very critical of the fast food industry and I believe that if you are a fan of that industry, this book will disturb and upset you.  As I said above, the picture Schlosser paints is not pretty, but it is well-researched and well-written.  A must read.	2001-05-21

Cities of Salt details the transition of an unnamed Arab emirate from how it had apparently been functioning to a current, oil producing state.  The story, taken as a whole is heartbreaking.  The story begins before oil is discovered, and tells a tale of a generous, yet human, people.  Their Emir, unbeknownst to them, allows some Americans into the country to test for oil and eventually, drilling takes place.  On the way, people are driven out of their homes, villages are leveled, lives irrevocably, irretrievably changed.  The old way of life is gone, and with it, the general pleasantness and generosity that had once been prevalent.  The story is of mainly of a place, the characters only secondary, for their is no true protagonist, save the land.  Characters play the lead for a time, but soon something happens, someone leaves, someone arrives and things change again.  Cities of Salt is a moving and bittersweet story told in a matter-of-fact manner, a story which mourns the passing of a way of life, without being mournful itself.	2001-05-21

While I enjoyed reading it, I found at times that there was nothing to propel me on, nothing to keep me up late at night reading.  But that's my major complaint about the book.  Otherwise, it's an enjoyable story that, although you can pretty much tell where the story will ultimately go if you are a fan of romantic comedies, takes all sorts of unexpected turns and is filled with some interesting characters.  While not quite as good as Ralph's Party, it is still an enjoyable, quick, light and sometimes funny read.	2001-05-18

This gentle man narrates the story of his life, the story of his books.  He has grown to love the doomed books that come to him, he is proud of his work, proud of what he has learned from his books.  This is a unique, imaginative novel, one that I think anyone who enjoys a non-traditional approach to novel writing would enjoy.  It is a wonderful story of a man who has found pleasure in life, doing a job which to many of us would seem tedious and depressing.

A&amp;R is a mediocre book about a very interesting topic.  There were many instances where it seemed like Flanagan was trying to be Tom Wolfe ala Bonfire of the Vanities, but there really aren't many writers who can pull that off.  There really isn't much of a plot, it must kind of meanders along in an episodic fashion that never really gets anywhere.  Things just sort of happen in the book without any real explanation.  Flanagan uses his characters a bit clumsily to get in his own opinion about the music industry and how it has developed.  Nevertheless, it is enjoyable reading, in that it's a quick read and, if you are interested in the record industry, it is an intereting portrayal of that industry.	2001-04-29

At just over 200 pages, this one won't take you very long to get through, which is a shame because it's such a lovely ride.  Damien March, is a sort of British/American amalgamation, as is his family.  When his Uncle Patrick dies, and bequests his home, albeit with many limiting strings attached, to Damien, Damien leaves his London life for life on an island in New England, where Patrick's ramshackle home is.  Damien comes to the US and gives us many bemused, amusing observations about American culture, given in an amusing fashion from one who sort of belongs in the US anyway.  Damien finds an old manuscript of his uncle's, the Confession of Mycroft Holmes.  The novel sends Damien on a journey he had technically begun when he left England, a journey which brings Damien a surprising discovery.  It's a lovely story, told in charming fashion.  Enjoy this one.	2001-04-29

I thought it would be a nice collection of connected short stories, but it is so much more than that.  The stories work more like a novel than a collection and Cronin has done marvelous things with these stories.  They follow two people, O'Neil, who is nineteen when we first meet him, and Mary, the woman he eventually marries.  Each story us about an emotionally pivotal experience that has ramifications for the rest of their lives, ramifications which surface in each of the following stories.  The stories are wonderfully written and affecting.  Each story could have been the springboard for a fully developed novel. Cronin fits so much in these stories in a terrifically effortless and smooth manner.  I highly recommend this one.	2001-04-22

Multiple Intelligences gave me all that and more, and I think that this book would probably be fabulous for people looking for more than I was.  I found the beginning and ends of the book very helpful and informative, but the middle was a little too theoretical for my purposes.  I kept thinking that it would be more appropriate for an education student or PTA president than a mere curious parent.  That being said, the beginning does an excellent job of laying down the groundwork for what MI is and what all the different learning styles are.  Gardner also has many interesting things to say about standardized testing, which is particularly timely given the current debate on the usefulness of the SAT.  I think MI theory will help any parent striving to get a grip on their children's educational experience.  MI theory has you look more at the whole child, rather than one or two particular skills, something I think we parents have known all along.  It's just nice to see that this theory is given such weight.	2001-04-19

There is nothing deep or earth shattering about this novel, it's just an enjoyable, amusing look at a particular time and place.  I personally derived much enjoyment out of this one because I kind of lived that life--leaving New Jersey at age 18 to go out of state to college and returning on breaks to work in the food service industry.  Perrotta does an excellent job of capturing that time with a very amusing tale.  The &quot;Joe&quot; of Joe College is Danny, a bright young man who goes to Yale and while at home, helps his dad out driving the Roach Coach, a coffee/lunch break on wheels for local office and industrial parks.  Over the summer, Danny got together with a woman he went to high school with who stayed in New Jersey.  Perrotta wonderfully highlights the tensions between Danny's two worlds and how he deals with them. He's got issues at school and issues at home, all believable, and Danny deals with them probably the way most 21 year olds would.  Joe College is a believable and very enjoyable look at life in college and life in New Jersey in the early 80s, sometimes very funny and always amusing.	2001-04-19

Dogs of Winter is a novel for those who want to face up to the more unseamly side of life, to see the world through the eyes of men who, while they probably haven't seen everything, have seen enough.  Jack Fletcher, the main character is a sort of washed up in everyone's eyes but his own photographer who is asked to photograph a legendary surfer, of his generation, in a legendary, almost mythic surfers cove.  He travels to Northern California where what happens to him is more about survival, survival and hope, than it is about mere surfing.  Nunn's plot takes many twists and turns and is full of enough characters to make it interesting, without being crowded of confusing.  Nunn reminds me a bit of Richard Ford in his contemplation of regret and loss, but he's of a different breed.  There is a wide open quality of his writing and his stories and somehow the setting melds with the writing.  I read Nunn's two earlier novels in the 80s and loved them.  He somehow fell off my radar screen, but I am glad to have discovered Dogs of Winter.  It is a complex work, a pleasure to read.	2001-04-17

Dubus is a wonderful writer, that much is clear.  His writing flows and the themes in the novel are quite thought provoking.  Generally, the plot in this novel is constructed very well (aside from one major problem) and I actually think that because of that, this book would make a good book club selection.  That being said, I have some major problems with this novel.  The entire conflict of the novel is based on events that could not happen in Northern California (Eastern Europe, maybe).  A woman's home is taken by the local tax authorities because of a clerical error and sold for nonpayment of taxes (a whopping $500 worth).  The tax agency sells her house almost immediately to an Iranian immigrant who had been in the United States for several years, desperately trying to hold on to the wealth his family once had in pre-Ayatollah Iran.  He has visions of selling the house and making money on it, she just wants her house back.  The way her house it taken from her just could never happen in California.  There are other details concerning the house, which I won't go into here (can't give too much away), that were equally as unbelievable.  I am sorry, but I just cannot suspend my disbelief that much.  The preposterousness of this factor of the story tainted the rest of it for me.  The novel is really a gritty, reality story, yet the entire conflict stems from an impossibility.  It was just too contrived for me.  Another problem I had was with the behavior of certain of the characters, particulary Kathy, the woman who owned the house.  Kathy narrates the novel, and as a narrator, she comes off fairly intelligent and thoughtful.  Her behavior and her conversations are far from that.  I think if Dubus wanted to make her more believable, her narrative voice should have been that of the vacuous, narrow-minded racist that she was, based on her actions.<br />With those flaws, House of Sand and Fog still has its merits.  Frankly, I found it hard to put down for the last 150 pages or so.  I just wish Dubus had been more true to Kathy's character and had come up with a more convincing reason as to both characters would have fought over the house.  Had he done so, this would have been a truly terrific novel.	2001-04-12

We follow two developing stories:  One of Peejoe, a young boy thrust into the racial conflicts of the mid-sixties in Alabama; the other of his Aunt Lucille, a woman on the run in search of fame in Hollywood after she murders her husband.  This is an amusing story, but I have one quibble.  I felt the two stories just didn't mesh well together.  Peejoe's story is serious (told, however, in a lighthearted manner).  There are deaths, lynching, sit-ins, etc, in other words, much food for thought.  Then we have the Lucille story.  She drives cross country with her husband's head in Tupperware.  She makes it big in Las Vegas and makes her way to Hollywood.  It's like a warped little fairy tale that just didn't fit in all that well with Peejoe's story.  Despite that quibble, Crazy in Alabama is a fun book to read and is ultimately satisfying.	2001-04-09

Gloria is a beautiful, wealthy, intelligent young women with every single advantage a woman in the late fifties could possibly have.  When I started this book, I thought, &quot;why should I care about this person?&quot;  There is something about her story, however, that will drive you to read on.  The novel takes place essentially over Gloria's summer between college and graduate school in the late fifties.  As the summer wears on, Gloria flashes back over most of her life, her horrible experience at boarding school, and her more positive experiences of high school and college.  She is trying to come to grips with what she should do with her life, trying to resolve all the unanswered questions that have plagued her since high school and have intensified in college.  What does she want out of life?  The country club steel executive wife life her mother leads, or something more, something more intellectual, more offbeat.  Gloria's dilemma is believable, her story, compelling.  It will be difficult to put this book down.  The characters are well-developed and the plot is unpredictable (but not outlandish at all).  Don't be intimidated by the 600+ pages, they are all worth it.	2001-04-09

Coetzee's Disgrace is a wonderful novel, wonderful on so many levels, in so many ways.  Wonderful in that it is a thought-provoking rumination on the nature of sin and disgrace, on the fall from grace, on redemption and grace.  Wonderful in that Coetzee is able to communicate so much with so few words, but without writing in a style one would term &quot;spare&quot;, for the writing here is rich, rich with evocative images, with depth.<br />Many here have said that they couldn't like David Lurie, the protagonist.  I neither liked nor disliked him, but found his  story fascinating.  He just is not &quot;likeable&quot;, yet I admired his honesty with himself and about himself.  He is not a &quot;nice&quot; person, but he never pretends to be, not even to himself.  He is a South African professor who, after his relationship with a high-class prostitute must end, takes up with one of his students.  That relationship ends and he ultimately loses his job because of it.  He is shunned, yet others are drawn to his story, fascinated by his fall from grace.   He moves to the country to live with Lucy, his grown daughter.  While there, he works with doomed animals, dogs and cats.  He comes to respect people he was initially disgusted with.  His situation gives him no room to reject others simply by their appearance.  His fall from grace has given him that.<br />When he and his daughter are brutally attacked, Coetzee forces us to ponder again on the nature of disgrace.  Does it make sense for a man to be shunned based on his affair with another consenting adult, when rapists escape any sort of punishment?  Are both crimes equal, sides of the same coin?  What is grace?  Who has it?  Is it found in an Eden lost forever, an Eden people keep seeking, never finding?  <br />I found Disgrace a fascinating, highly readable study of human nature, human reactions, human situations, human prejudices.  There is so much more to the novel than what I have covered here--the state of present day South African, racism, hypocrisy, animal rights--all in a short, well written book.  Highly recommended.	2001-03-28

The Testament of Yves Gudrun was ultimately a little too uneven for me and left me with too many unanswered questions; it just didn't make sense, when I think it was actually trying to.  To her credit, Barton writes well, is imaginative, has a good ear for dialog, and has a certain uncanny knack for getting in these little zingers that make you think here and there in the narrative.  The premise of the novel is pretty interesting.  We read about a pre-industrial society that, we soon realize, exists in the current day.  They are visited by Ruth Blum, a young anthropologist at the same time Yves invents a few technical improvements which begin to change their society.  Barton also tells the story from an interesting point of view (instead of from Ruth's point of view, she tells it from that of Yves'.)  But--there are also some problems with this novel.  First of all, I just don't think the narrative hung together.  It almost struck me as a first draft, one that needs a little work to become something wonderful, which was frustrating.  Or perhaps it was a short story, that should have ended at page 30.  Some things just made no sense, like why did Yves' wife sing the blues?  Why did they focus on Ruth's love of toast?  I also think this novel would have been improved with some research.  It struck me that she just made things up about how a pre-industrial society would operate.  The details just seemed a little too inauthentic.  That being said, I think Ms. Barton is talented and will try her next effort.	2001-03-24

The FBI is investigating, the dead boy's sister wants to sleep with Neil, Neil's best friend suspects the worst.  Neil is haunted by guilt and puzzled by his father's behavior.  Watt ties it all together in the end, not too neatly, simply masterfully.<br />Diamond Dogs is a well-written thriller.  It is very quick reading because you won't be able to put it down.  Watt has taken us back to high school quite convincingly.  Neil is not the most likeable character in the world, given that he reveals tales from his life in which his behavior wasn't all that admirable.  He's not bad, but he's not good either.  Ultimately, though, the reader will feel sorry for him, torn between wanting him to get away with what he has done, and wanting him to feel the relief that confession will bring.  Well done.	2001-03-18

Sharon, the heroine of the novel, is like so many other female protagonists, but with an additional twist that makes this novel really interesting.  Sharon is funny, in search of love.  You're probably thinking, I now what this one will be about.  But the twist is that she is in search of spirituality and that search gives the novel an additional layer that makes it so enjoyable, so thought provoking.  When we meet Sharon, she has just been dumped by her boyfriend whom she has followed cross country, from Boston to Hawaii.  She struggles to pick up the pieces of her life and to actually get a life.  We follow her for about 20 years until she finally finds happiness, love and the resolution of her spiritual quest.  Sharon is really an endearing character.  She's pretty flaky, but in a charming way.  She's honest, she's funny, you can't help but root for her and hope she someday finds what she is searching for.  The novel follows her through several men and many potential solutions to her spiritual quest.  Allegra Goodman has concocted a wonderful, extremely well written and engaging story.  I highly recommend this one.	2001-03-17

I have some criticism of the book, but also some praise.  First the criticism.  This is really a philosophy text pretending to be a novel.  (Which, I believe is ultimately a good thing).  The characters are not that believable and are really just devices Gaarder uses to get his point across.  The dialog is not believable either.  Another potential problem for certain readers is that the philosophy lessons contained in this book are, in the novel, aimed at a 15 year old girl.  If you have studied philosophy at some point in your life, this will probably be far too simplistic for you.<br />I still would recommend this book and here's why.  Sophie's World will be an excellent read for anyone with a curiosity about philosophy, but who finds the whole thing a bit intimidating.  I think it's a wonderful introduction to philosophy because it is aimed at that 15 year old character.  Even if you have studied philosophy, this book will be thought provoking, if only because it makes you think about what you once studied.  I think this would be a wonderful book for parents of teenage children to read with their children.  It would certainly make for some excellent discussions.  The true strength of this book is the material it covers.  Philosophy is a fascinating subject and Sophie's World is the perfect choice for anyone who would like to gently ease themselves into that subject.	2001-03-13

That said, I loved t his novel.  Michael Chabon has really outdone himself here.  The story is wonderful and is big enough to fill the 600 plus pages in the novel.  What I really loved is the writing.  Chabon has so much fun with words and it is a pleasure to read every sentence.<br />We meet Joe Kavalier and Sammy Klayman when they are in their late teens.  It is pre-WW2 Brooklyn and Joe has just escaped (and daringly so) from Prague.  We follow them as they create a comic book character which lifts Sammy out of the dull life he has been leading and allows Joe to follow his dream of vengeance against the Nazis who in effect forced him to escape Prague and leave the family he loves.  Sammy marries and has a child, but Joe fights in the war and then disappears (but not for the reader).  Their story is fascinating and wonderful.  The characters are hilarious and, well, true characters.  Michael Chabon has done a tremendous job.  The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay is funny, touching and engaging, a true delight.

Susan Minot takes us into Ann's dying thoughts, her remembrances in a beautiful and evocative novel.  Ann has married three times, had several children, had one die.  She has lived what others would consider a privileged life, yet these dying thoughts reveal otherwise.  Many many years before, prior to her marriages, she had a brief encounter with a man who she believes was her one true love.  The memories of her life fade and blend in her mind, yet the weekend she was with Harris Arden remains clear in every detail.  Ann does not come across as a warm and loving parent, or even a very good friend.  She does come across as a human, a human with emotions that were stunted when the reality of her love for Harris and what will happen becomes clear to her.  Evening is a beautifully written novel, full of evocative prose.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  A word of caution, however.  The Evening narrative jumps around in time without any concrete guidance.  If novels like that bother you, think twice before picking this one up.  Otherwise, enjoy the read.  It's marvelous.  Susan Minot is very talented and Evening is a beautiful novel.	2001-03-05

AHWOSG is brilliant and well written.  Eggers' story really is tragic, yet he makes us laugh all the way through.  His parents die within a few weeks of each other and at 21, Eggers must care for his young brother Toph.  Eggers' writing shows exceptional talent and promise.  I know that he has been troubled by the idea of profitting off of the loss of his parents, but frankly I don't see it that way.  He is profitting off the strenghts of his talents.  The book definitely is a little rough around the edges.  He sometimes uses extremely awkward devices to get things he wants to say in the novel (such as a fake interview with MTV, which goes on for pages and pages).  Eggers is at his best when he is just telling his story about raising his brothers and dealing with the obstacles which naturally come with his situation.  One of the things I loved about the book was his honesty.  He openly admits that he went to open house at his brother's grade school hoping to meet an attractive single mother.  Eggers also is honest with his yearnings to be on his own and his deep love for his brother.  I also found it interesting that Eggers seemingly does not realized that so much of what he experienced as a parent is universal.  What parent hasn't been nagged by a terrible, and totally paranoid fear that the wonderful babysitter he or she has just entrusted his children to will turn out to be an ax murderer.  What parent hasn't chastised their children for not dressing themselves and being late.  Eggers take on all of the mundane aspects of parenting is completely refreshing.  This book, for all the sadness, will keep you laughing, out loud.	2001-03-05

The tale of Molly Benson, the spacey Graham Greene-obsessed do-gooder and her ill-advised trip to Algeria is entertaining and amusing.  Gloria Emerson has a knack of drawing characters with obvious and amusing flaws, without making her narrative or characterization seem obvious, contrived or hackneyed.  This is a short novel, one that you can enjoy in a few gulps, but you won't get the sense of being cheated.  Molly is quite a character.  She met Graham Greene, briefly, once and from that meeting believed, in her own mind that she and Greene were quite close.  After his death, she believes he would have wanted her to lead an expedition to Algeria and she drags a couple of her friends there.  Molly lives in a world of delusion.  You'll read about her and think, &quot;This woman is a little nuts, the world is simply not as she imagines it&quot;.  Her life is both funny and sad.  Funny in that her delusions lead her to do amusing things, sad in that she has the delusions at all.  I think, though, that most will find slivers of themselves in her, for who doesn't act believing in something that just is not true, or won't happen, out of sheer hopefulness.  Emerson has given us an amusing character study and a very well-written novel. Enjoy.	2001-03-02

This was my first Murakami, so I cannot compare it with any of his other work, but I can compare it to other novels and this one is clearly a cut above most.  It is the story of Toru, a young college student who becomes involved with the girlfriend of his best friend who, a year earlier, commited suicide.  The two deal with their unspoken grief as best they can, both following utterly different paths.  Toru loves the woman, Naoko, but for various reasons, their relationship cannot develop normally.  We follow Toru for a few years in college--a realistic portrait of a young man's journey toward adulthood.  The story is narrated by Toru's 37 year old self.  He hears Norwegian Wood in an airplane and memories of his youth come flooding back to him, so much so that he must tell his story.  The story rings so true, it definitely took me back to that time in my life.  The novel starts off a little slowly and then gradually builds to where you cannot put it down.  It's a beautiful story filled with the pain, the awe, the confusion, the wonderment of being young and on one's own, of confronting life for the first time, of messing up, of growing up.  Norwegian Wood is great.  I highly recommend it.	2001-03-01

Catherine Bush has given us a terrific story that will make you think about the nature of love and war, of bravery, cowardice and risk.  Arcadia Hearne is a Toronto native living in self-imposed exile in London.  As the novel unfolds, we learn, little by little, about why seh left, and what she has done in London.  She left because two of her lovers had a duel over her. The pain of the consequences of the duel was too overwhelming for her, so she fled, escaping to London.  Her story, and how she finally addresses her past and deals with issues in the present, is fascinating and well-told.  Bush tells the story, plaing concepts of love and war against one another.  It's wonderful food for thought.  There is a revelation towards the end of the novel--almost blink and you've missed it--that you won't get out of your head.  I highly recommend this one.

However, if a very loose interpretation of the Bible, or someone taking liberties with Biblical history will offend you, do not read this book.  Otherwise, read on.  The Red Tent is the story of Dinah, Jacob's daughter.  She narrates in a beautiful poetic voice that is all at once a familiar friend.  Her story, while heartbreaking, is also a celebration of what it is to be female.  She begins telling us about what happened before she was born, how Jacob came to have four wives, how his sons were born.  Her focus is on the wives and their tradition of abiding in the red tent during menses.  While they are there, the woman bond and after she, the only surviving daughter of Jacob, is born, she spends much time there with her mothers, learning female traditions of midwifery.  Her story is familiar, yet not the same as in the good book.  Diamante's story is breathtakingly imaginative.  Leah and her sisters come alive in this novel.  While reading it, you are in the red tent.  The characters are completely believable, the story utterly compelling.  We follow Dinah throughout her life.  Her pain and her pleasures come alive. I highly recommend this book.  Don't be intimidated by the Biblical history aspect of it.  This novel comes alive from the first page and you won't be able to put it down.	2001-02-14

Books	4	2	3	N	N	An Amusing Read	If I simply described Dave, the narrator of this novel, you would think, I don't want to read a book about someone like that.  He best friend has asked that he spend time with Liz, the best friend's girlfriend while he (the friend) travels for a year.  He is completely infatuated with her and when she suggests travelling to India for a few months before school begins, he leaps at the chance, not because he is interested in India at all, but because he is interested in Liz.  But read the book, you'll like him.  Anyone who has traveled as a college student will probably identify with the culture shock he experiences.  The story is told with much good humor and Dave actually grows as a person (he really still has a lot more to do as the book closes, but he's still 19).  He learns to travel on his own and appreciate India.  He's still young, so of course he has the requisite wild nights and he really has some difficulties accepting that he is in India, a country he didn't really want to see.  He learns more about himself and human nature than he does about India.  This is not the young man travels and becomes a better man kind of novel.  Rather, it's a humorous look at something many young people wind up doing, filled with amusing characters similar to flesh and blood ones we have all no doubt met up with.  If you don't take this one too seriously, you will enjoy this book.	2001-02-12

It is the story of a seemingly happily married couple whose marriage breaks down on each end.  He has an affair, and she becomes involved in religion, something he as an athieist cannot embrace.  The story is told with a light and humorous tone, yet all along St. John makes us think about the temporariness of our lives, how seemingly permanent things can change based on seemingly meaningless events.  The characters are humorous, all sort of exaggerations, at times, of people we all know.  <br />If you are looking for something light, but would like to think a bit, I recommend this book.  It is entertaining and easy to read, yet still thought provoking.	2001-02-12

It starts off really strong but the ending, while good, is not as good as the rest of the book.  It's the story of Claire, a therapist who many years ago gave up an infant daughter for adoption, and Claire's patient Jody, a young woman confused about her future.  Claire begins to suspect that Jody is the daughter she gave away.   Both women have slightly troubling personal lives.  Many of their relationships have shortcomings that neither is particularly happy with and they begin to rely on the patient-therapist relationship too much.  This is a witty, darkly comic psychological thriller that is very, very readable.  I really could not put it down.  As I said earlier, the ending is not as strong as the beginning, but it's still quite good.  The not-so-rosy picture of the world Homes paints for us rings very true.  If you like dark humor, you'll like this novel.	2001-02-05

I was so pleased to discover a copy in a used book store, and even more pleased upon reading it.  The story revolves around Bruno, a dying old man, and the people in his life--both living and not.  Murdoch once again demonstrates her incredible talent to explore the realities of human relationships, to get you thinking on the nature of friendship and love.  The novel is at times humorous, serious, philisophical and bittersweet.  A truly enjoyable read.	2001-02-02

A young student nurse dies during a training exercise, another is found dead in her bed.  The first could have been the result of a practical joke gone bad, the second, a suicide.

The young women explore the grimy underside of life--barhopping, getting picked up by sleazy older men--while maturing in the process. One must face an unwanted pregnancy, while another, the truth about her sexuality.  The six girls we follow have a depth of true to life emotions that they must handle.  Because of their youth, all mishandle, in some way or other, these emotions.  The writing here is fabulous--funny, exhuberant and energetic.  The young women are all completely believable.  This book will definitely transport you to the insecurities and the excitement of being young, thinking you can conquer the world.  Highly recommended.	2001-01-31

There is just a little too much focus on bodily parts.  Lots of times I felt that I was reading an inside joke, for men only.  I can see that it's well written and sometimes funny and I am sure that some would find this absolutely wonderful.  I just didn't.  I really felt that I had just spent a lot of time with an obnoxious 12 year old boy.  If that's your cup of tea, by all means, I recommend this book, but if you'd rather curl up with a cup of tea, read another book.	2001-01-30

The beginning reminded me a bit of Angela's Ashes--but then went on to take many dark turns.  Instead of coming to America to become a teacher, as Frank McCourt did, Henry becomes an IRA assassin with no real loyalty to anyone, save the woman who taught him how to write his name.  Henry is well written and entertaining, as are all Doyle's novels plus there is the added bonus of an Irish history lesson.	2001-01-29

We meet Stella Benson as she is about to take a new job, away from her native London.  She narrates her story in an interesting way.  We have virtually no background information on her, only what she chooses to tell us.  We are kept guessing for a while about what her job is, what she is running from, why.  Every 40 pages or so, she slips one of her secrets in, sometimes drawn out through conversation with the other characters.  I really liked that technique.  She talks to us as if we are her best friends, yet hides important things from us.  Our perspective on her story is constantly shifting.  You imagine her reasons are thus and so, yet they turn out not to be.  Stella's navigation through her new life is quite amusing and entertaining.  Stella tries to figure out what makes the people in her new world tick, just as we are trying to figure her out.  It's a great, fun book, an entertaining read.	2001-01-28

It's court room, suspense novel, told in an interesting, and realistic way.  One of the problems I have with a lot of legal thrillers is that they are completely unrealistic, but this one is completely believable, well-written.  Bohjalian has you wondering right up until the end as to what the verdict is going to be--was she guilty of murder, of anything?  The story of Sybil, a midwife accused of murder when a homebirth goes horribly, horribly wrong is told from the vantage point of her daughter who was a young girl at the time, but is now a practicing Obstetrician.  This is the sort of novel that's best if you can just zip right through it--perfect reading for a vacation, or a weekend away.  The characters are interesting and believable and certain things happen at the end that will surprise you.  It's definitely one of the better Oprah picks.	2001-01-26

Charles Baxter is truly a master.  Feast is a highly enjoyable book, a wonderful read.  The novel develops in an interesting manner.  Instead of having an omniscient narrator, or first person narrative, we have a collection of people telling their story to the writer Charles Baxter who is trying to work through his writer's block.  If the real Charles Baxter ever had any kind of writer's block, he certainly got over it with Feast of Love.  The novel revolves around Bradley Smith, a youngish man who's been married and divorced several times.  He tells his story to Baxter, as do Bradley's friends, neighbors and ex-wives.  The novel is indeed a feast of love, as well as a feast of life.  Baxter gives us a wonderful slice of life in America in the current day.  The story is a funny rumination on the nature of love, how it develops, how it ends, how it grows.  The characters' observations are witty without seeming to obvious, or trying too hard.  The writing is fantastic.  This is one to enjoy.  Highly recommended.	2001-01-24

It's funny, imaginative and well-drawn and pokes fun at one of my daughter's hangups (she is a very picky eater).  The story it tells is funny and I think it really captures the imagination of young children.  A young boy tells us about his picky sister and how one night, he gets her to eat all the foods she hates by telling her they are magical foods (as an example, mashed potatoes are snow clouds from Mt. Fuji). All his ideas are really funny.  As a narrator, I can really get into telling this story and it has my kids in hysterics.  It also enables my picky eater to see how silly it is to be a picky eater.  Maybe it's just that she is growing up (almost 5), but I do think that this book is helping her be less picky.  We imitate what the boy in the story did by making up exotic names and sources for food she thinks she doesn't like, and it works!  I recommend this book highly.  It's yummy.  You will have a good time reading it and your kids will enjoy hearing it and looking at the terrific illustrations.	2001-01-09

I recognize that he's got a lot of five star reviews and perhaps they saw things I did not see, or were not bothered by things that bothered me.  Brauner's strengths are his humor (he's totally hilarious, in the Dennis Miller vein) and his ability to depict the inner feelings of a young person in transition, someone who thinks they are on the outside looking in, realizing there really is no in or out.  We follow Ronnie Shorenstein, a recent college grad, and his involvement with his hippie girlfriend's eco-friendly, activist crowd.  Ronnie is reminds me of a lot of people in their early twenties, confused about what to do, and who they are.  Ronnie is trying to figure it out, while remaining aloof, trying really hard not to care, because for some reason he thinks that's the way to be.  The novel is really funny and Brauner every ten or so pages comes up with a dead-on, absolutely brilliant observation about life that will make you laugh out loud.  Now the weaknesses.  His dialog needs work.  It was wooden and clunky at times.  Character development is also weak.  Ronnie's sister Eva swings into his life and plays a major role in the novel, but I never understood their relationship and what motivated her to do some things.  The girlfriend.  She sounds wonderful, but what was she doing with Ronnie in the first place.  He was constantly mean to her in the beginning of the book.  It just didn't make sense that they were together.  I found Ronnie to be very annoying at times, so I did not want to stay up late reading this novel.  The plotting was also a bit slow.  In most comedic novels, there is some sort of tension that keeps your reading on--there's none of that here.  That being said, I still give it 4 stars (3 1/2, but you can't do that here).   The humor is wonderful, the witty observations delightful.  I look forward to readingBrauner's later works and hope that he has a better editor this time.	2000-12-24

It is a brilliant, entertaining, thought-provoking history of the last 500 years in the West.  At times I felt like I should put the book down and bow down saying &quot;We are not worthy.&quot;  Barzun is a brilliant man and only someone who has lived so long, and studied so much written this master piece.  This is not a book to read quickly.  You could really do well reading about ten pages a day, and thinking about those pages all day.  You won't agree with everything Barzun says, for he can be very opinionated (but in a non-obnoxious way), and frankly I don't think he would want us to agree with all he says.  Reading this book is like sharing the brilliance of a learned college professor.  He wants you to think about history.  I generally don't go for history books, I am much more of a fiction reader, but this was such a fabulous read.  I would recommend it to any one with an interest in history or who feels guilty for cutting classes in college.  From Dawn to Decadence will be a way for you to catch up on some of what you missed.	2000-12-10

Anil's Ghost is not a typical novel and is thus not for every reader.  The story is not told in a linear fashion, but rather Ondaatje meanders around the facts, circles around the truth.  Anil Tissera returns to Sri Lanka after and 18 year absence as a forensic anthropologist on a fact-finding mission.  She is paired with Sarath Diyasena, a man several years her senior who has never left.  Together, they discover a government coverup of a murder from the skeletal remains of a man they nickname &quot;Sailor&quot;.  That is what happens in the novel, but that is certainly not the whole of it.  As we read the novel, we learn about Anil, Sarath, Sarath's brother and their intertwined relationships.  What really is Anil's Ghost?  Is it the ghost of sailor, the ghost of Anil's life, the ghost of Sri Lanka, or is it all of those things.  Ondaatje message is that the truth can never really be found, that stories of terrible atrocities don't have a clear cut beginning and end, just as Anil's Ghost has no such beginning and no such end.  I really enjoyed this book immensely, but, as is apparent from reading other reviews at this site, it is clearly not for everyone.  It reminded me a lot of Mrs. Dalloway, but with a much more tragic overlaying layer.  If you have no fear of an unconventional novel, if you don't need a linear story, this is a novel for you.	2000-12-07

Marion Keyes has done it again.  It's the perfect choice if you are looking for some quality light reading.  I see on these pages, everyone mentions which of her books is their favorite.  Well, Rachel's Holiday is mine.  While Watermelon and Lucy Sullivan were definitely great and funny, in my opinion, Rachel's Holiday is a cut above.  We still get the same chatty, humorous tone that makes all of Keyes'  novels such a pleasure to read, but this story is a little different a little more daring.  Keyes has added the complication of addiction on the girl meets boy, girl loses boy, girl gets that boy or another boy story.  Rachel narrates this story with much humor and we see her grow as a person.  When we first meet her, she is about to be admitted to the Cloisters, a sort of Betty Ford Clinic in Ireland.  She is in denial.  She had me fooled.  For the first part of the book, she is pretty shallow and definitely mired in her denial, but she grows as a person through her therapy and her friendships with other recovering addicts and finally admits to her addiction and ultimately beats it.  In the background is her life in New York that got her in The Cloisters in the first place, and Luke, the hunky Irishman who finally could take no more of her antics.  (It wouldn't be a Marion Keyes novel without a perfect hunky guy).  Be prepared.  This novel has a standard story book happy ending that I felt was just a tad too much.  But it's a funny book with charming characters (you can't even dislike Rachel).  You'll find yourself sneaking away for a quick fix of this wonderful, funny, breezy novel.  Enjoy!	2000-11-25

The story of Katinka, the frustrated writer who falls in love with her mailman, struggling with whether or not he is truly &quot;right&quot; for her is amusing, entertaining and engaging.  Katinka and the other characters are very believable, and Mail is the kind of book that will keep you thinking about it during your day, wondering what will happen next.  The plot is well-paced and unpredictable, without being completely outlandish.  It's not laugh-out-loud funny, but it is amusing.  My one complaint is that at times the writing seemed to be almost too careful, too buttoned up.  Sometimes I wished Medwed would have just broken loose, and the book could have been funnier.  Taken in its entiretly, however, this is a pleasant read, a comforing read, the literary equivalent of Mom's macaroni and cheese.	2000-11-17

I find it hard to believe this is his first novel.  And what an imaginative one!  Strauss heard the story of Chang and Eng, the &quot;Siamese&quot; twins, who lived in North Carolina before and after the Civil War, married sisters and fathered 21 children.  He was intrigued (who wouldn't be) to the extent that the story inspired him to write his first novel.  And it is a novel.  Strauss has created a world, the twins' world, which may or may not be close to the truth.  But truth is not the point of this novel, it is a wonderful work of fiction.  Strauss is imaginative, without going overboard.  The story he has given us is believable and thought provoking.  Other reviewers have said this novel made them feel uncomfortable, and I have to agree with them, but to me, it wasn't a bad uncomfortable.  Rather, Strauss made me have a vague hint of what it must have been like to have been Chang or Eng.  No privacy in an absolute, claustrophobic sense.  Strauss has remarkable character development in this rather short novel.  He has made believable a truly unbelievable story (21 children?).  He takes us to a world with masterful skill.  Chang and Eng is a truly great novel.  It makes you think about what it is to be human, to be alone with people right there, to be a freak.  Enjoy this novel.	2000-11-11

It is a fable about the relationships between men and women and the healing power of love.  I really enjoyed reading it and honestly can say that I have never read a book quite like this before.  It is the story of a house of gentle men, where unloved women come to be loved by men.  There is no sex in this house, only love.  One woman who comes there, Charlotte, has been horrible wronged by men.  She was brutally raped as a young girl and became pregnant.  She gave birth to the baby in secret and left him in the woods.  He was rescued by the daughter of the house's owner and raised as her child.  Several years later, one of the remorseful rapists comes to the house for redemption.  He and Charlotte fall in love, without her knowing his true identity.  They eventually learn the truth about each other, but I won't say anymore, for fear of ruining the book for anyone.  Kathy Hepinstall gets her message about love across in such a unique way in this book.  Love and physical affection should be gentle.  She cleverly juxtaposes the story of a young man who lives in a barn next to the house, who has sex, without love, with several of the women who visit the house.  Hepinstall's message is simple--sex without love is harmful, sometimes violent.  Women deserve gentle love.  She gets her message across without being preachy, which is one of the wonderful things about this novel.  The House of Gentle Men is also a pleasure to read.  Hepinstall writes beautifully.  I really enjoyed this novel.  Enjoy.	2000-10-17

While it definitely will be useful to all working moms, I have a feeling that the longer you have worked, the less likely it will be you will find really useful pointers in this book.  However, if you're about to go back to work, you've got to read this book.  Personally, I have been working for 4 years after having my kids, so I didn't really find the beginning chapters on organization all that helpful.  I had already figured a lot out myself.  That being said, I really wish I had seen those chapters 4 years ago, they would have saved me a lot of time and aggravation.  What I did find helpful was her hints on how to handle kids being in school, something I have recently started to experience.  Those chapters made me feel like I am not the only one facing the problems I am facing.  What I found really important, and what I fear a lot of working moms don't focus on is the last chapter in the book, the chapter dealing with taking care of yourself.  She lets you know it's ok to get a facial, a manicure, a massage, if you can do it, because as a working mom, you deserve it.  <br />As I said above, this is a terrific book.  If you have been out there working for a while, you probably know a lot of these things Goldman discusses in her book, but in that case, buy the book and give it to a coworker or friend who is just returning to work.  She'll thank you for it immensely.	2000-10-11

It snuck up on me.  I started reading it thinking it was a nice, coming of age in New Jersey novel, but after about 50 pages, I realized it is so much more than that.  As a coming of age novel, it is wonderful.  Reikien's prose is so evocative of a particular place and time (northern New Jersey, 1979-1981).  But this novel is about so much more.  It is about the tremendous hold the past has over us, how it keeps being repeated, in our actions and in our minds.  It is about stories--the stories we tell, the stories we omit and what the listener/reader must extrapolate from beyond the boundaries of what is told.  I highly recommend this book.  I don't think you have to be from New Jersey, or in your thirties to appreciate what happens to Anthony Rubin, the wonderful protagonist, and his family.  His parents separate after his father's affair with his best friend's mother and Anthony falls in love with the girl next door, whose father just could be in the mafia.  A wonderful story, wonderfully told.  I highly recommend it.	2000-10-09

You should follow your heart regarding marriage and men who don't respect women should watch out.  Princess Smartypants has an excellent life.  She spends her days with her animals and is happy.  Her only problem is she is plagued by suitors who only want to marry her for her wealth and beauty, but do not appreciate her for who she really is.  She gives into pressure from her parents and agrees to hear out her suitors, but cleverly devises a plan to make them all go away.  She challenges them to a fitness test which none of them can pass.  She is quite happy until the last one comes along and passes all of her tests.  He is cocky and overconfident and his tragic flaw is that he didn't think Princess Smartypants was so smart at all.  So she kisses him and turns him into a toad.  All the other princes run away and she lives happily ever after with her animals.  My description may sound heavy, but the story is told with much wit and charm.  My four year old loves the story, much more so than the Disney stories.  I highly recommend this book for all parents of toddlers.  I think it teaches young children that there are alternative routes to happiness, but it never takes itself too seriously.	2000-10-06

I feel like such a sour puss because Pay It Forward is based on such a wonderful premise: do three people a favor and instead of asking them to pay you back, ask them to pay your favor forward.  They should each do favors for three more people, and so forth.  Great idea, right?  But it comes to us in a poorly written novel.  The character development is non-existent. So many of the characters in this novel do things which make no sense.  The narrative is disjointed and has no flow.  Hyde uses devices to get certain aspects of the story into the narrative and these devices just do not work.  As an example, when she wants to get into a character's head, she inserts an excerpt from other, fictional books about the events taking place in the novel.  These fictional books just seemed so contrived and I thought there would be better ways to get her point across.<br />Because this book has such a fabulous premise, I believe the movie will be better than the book.  I recommend waiting for the movie and focusing on the intriguing message of the book.  Don't waste your time on the book at all.  It's not worth it.	2000-09-25

The Blind Assassin is a fantastic, fabulous novel and I cannot recommend it highly enough.  Margaret Atwoood has written a terrific story told in such a way that the reader will always be kept guessing as to what the true &quot;truth&quot; is.  It is a mystery, with a death, but it is not a &quot;mystery novel&quot; as we come to expect.  The Blind Assassin is the story of two sisters:  Laura and Iris Chase.  Laura died in what may or may not have been a suicidal car crash in 1945.  Iris tells the story of her family and the events leading up to Laura's death, reflecting in the present on the events of the past.  What is so fascinating about The Blind Assassin is that things are not always what they seem, but there are layers upon layers of story, of truth.  Atwood reveals the story to us in many ways.  We see newspaper accounts of what happened to the Chase family.  These accounts are told with the confidence that they convey the whole, true story, but do they?  Then we hear Iris' story, but something is not right with her story, something is missing.  Iris admits that she has omitted crucial details and bit by bit, the reader is able to piece together what did happen.  Interspersed in Iris' narrative are excerpts from Laura's posthumously publised novel, The Blind Assassin, which also give us insight into what happened.  Atwood tells this story marvelously.  Iris' observations about the present day are witty and sharp.  Atwood kept me guessing right up until the end.  The mystery of this novel makes it just that much more fun to read.  The Blind Assassin is a wonderful addition to the body of work of one of the most talented living authors.  I highly, highly recommend it.	2000-09-25

Eve, our heroine, has finally gotten engaged at age 36.  She tells us the story of her engagement in an interesting way.  We get little snippets of her life during that period. Her bickering with her fiance, her therapy sessions, her doubts, her misgivings. Ingiving us these bits and pieces of Eve's life, Finnamore somehow manages to also give us the whole picture.  I felt I really knew Eve--she is a complicated, multi-dimensional character.  She's got an amusingly snide, ironic sense of humor that is great fun to experience.  Her story, while making me laugh, also made me think--about the nature of love and marriage, and wjy woman feel such pressure to get married.  Suzanne Finnamore has a great talent.  Her work is unique, engaging, entertaining and thought provoking.  I highly recommend it.	2000-09-21

After seeing all of the great reviews for The Year of Jubilo, I bought the  book, but I must admit, it sat on my bookcase for a while because it was  sort of intimidating.  Was I really going to like it?  The answer is yes.   This novel has a lot to recommend for fans of Civil War fiction, and fans  of well-written novels.  Howard Bahr is a wonderful writer and this book,  while I finished it a few days ago, is constantly on my mind.  As the novel  opens, we meet Gawain Harper who is returning to his home after the Civil  War.  He reluctantly fought for the CSA and now is anxious about what lies  ahead for him in the town he grew up in.  He is most concerned about  Morgan, the love he left to fight in the war.  The concerns he focuses on  as he returns home, are not those he must deal with when he gets home.   Much of his world is turned upside down.  Morgan still loves him, but old  alliances have crumbled  and much of his town has burned down.  He must  make sense out of the post-war South, of his post-war life.  He manages to  face down fears that have haunted him since before he left for the war.   <br />This novel is well-told and thought provoking.  I highly recommend it.	2000-09-19

The book is organized well, broken  down by the various sorts of speech problems, so it's quite easy for a lay  person to focus on their concerns without having to wade through lots of  irrelevant information.  I came to the book with the same question:  Does  my child have a speech problem and this book helped me find the answer and  led me to the help we needed.  I strongly recommend this book for any  parent with that same question.  It will help you find your answer and help  you see that you are not alone.	2000-09-15

My daughter was evaluated by a Speech and Language pathologist who  told me she needed therapy and was a high risk for a learning disability.   I got the written evaluation, but had nothing to help me review it  critically until I got this book.  This book has been a tremendous help in  that area.  It discusses how an evaluation should proceed and what the test  scores really mean.  It gives the parent a tremendous amount of very useful  information in the speech, language and listening areas.  It also gives you  benchmarks, by age, of where your child should be in those areas.  All this  is done briefly, succintly.  This book made sense of an area that I found  so confusing.  The information found in this book will be useful to the  parent of any child suspected of having a speech, language or listening  delay or disorder.  It also helps parents seek assistance in these areas.   Each potential problem is discussed individually, as well as different  types of treatment for those problems.  If you have even the slightest  reason to suspect your child has an issue in these areas, or an educator or  speech and language pathologist is telling you your child does, you must,  must read this book.  It will provide you with valuable information and  enable you  to speak intelligently so that you may better help your child.	2000-09-14

This novel is the classic romantic  comedy in that the reader can pretty much figure out who the right guy is  for Lucy, our heroine, but she seems to somehow always miss it until about  three-quarters through the book.  The book is full of amusing characters  who will remind you of people you have met and Lucy is a realistic, if  flawed, character.  She always seems to fall for the wrong man and is blind  to the reasons why he is wrong.  I know some reviewers here have said that  she was too wimpy, or needed a backbone, but I have known a lot of women,  who in their early twenties were just like that.  While Lucy Sullivan is  not as laugh out loud funny as Watermelon, it is still a well-done romantic  comedy with a narrative that doesn't fall apart.  I enjoyed reading it and  would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something light and  enjoyable.	2000-09-07

We follow  Danny as he grows into an oversexed middle aged man.  The story is funny  and well-written for the most part.

I bought it especially because my daughter, like  Wemberly, is very worried about starting her new school.  When she heard  Wemberly was worried about that, she said &quot;I'm worried about that too,  Mommy.&quot;  Right then, I knew I had bought a great book.  We read it  over and over and it gives her great comfort to know that she is not the  only child who worries.  The best thing is Wemberly gets to school and  makes a new friend.  The experience is positive and all the things that she  worried about did not happen.  This is a great message for all kids (I  think it's rare that a four year old child would not worry about certain  things).  Aside from a great message, the story has good humor and Henkes  wonderful illustrations.  I am so glad I got this book for my daughter, we  read it at least 4 times before bed each night.  Happy reading.	2000-09-01

Elementals  is an engaging collection of fairy tale-ish stories  that are a delight to  read.  Byatt has a wonderful way with the English language.  Her writing is  delicate and precise without being too precious.  She has such incredible  range not just within this collection, but in everything she has written.   Her Possession: A Romance is one of my favorite novels, but it really isn't  anything like Elementals.  (Which is not to say that if you like one, you  won't like the other)  This is not a large volume, but a wonderful way to  spend a few hours transported into other worlds by an extremely talented  writer.

She writes like a  dream and brings you into the worlds of her stories so effectively.  She  certainly is a writer of enormous talent and I only hope she gives us more  work soon.  All the stories in this collection concern the culture clash  between America and India.  Clash is perhaps too strong a word.  It is more  like the two worlds are bumping into one another, trying to make some sense  of the other.  As with any collection, some stories are stronger than  others (although none are weak).  The first and last were my favorites.   The first--A Temporary Matter--deals with a young couple coping with the  stillbirth of their first child and the disintegration of their marriage  during a week of hour long blackouts.  The last--The Third and Final  Continent--is told by an Indian man of his first days in Boston, before and  after he brought his new bride to the country.  All of these stories are  beautifully rendered.  I highly recommend this collection.	2000-08-25

This one takes place in the life of a family of four, over four days.  Each of them is hunting for  something, sometimes physical, sometimes metaphysical, sometimes both.   Charles, the husband is initially seeking a gun that belonged to his  step-father, but he is also seeking his youth, before he screwed up his  life.  His wife, Joan, is searching for answers about her life, about  whether she belongs in her marriage, with her family.  Their young son,  Micah is really just searching for some sense in this world he is growing  up in.  His half-sister Lyris, who has returned to the family after living  in a foster home is also trying to make sense of the quasi-suburban world  in which this family lives.  This story is marvelously told with Drury's  wonderful deadpan humor.  Much of the ridiculousness of our lives now is  observed, without comment from either the characters or Drury, yet somehow  we see that things can be weird in the US right now.  Weird in a hilarious  way.  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and highly recommend it.	2000-08-24

I came to this book after a speech therapist recommended that my four year old daughter be tested for ADD.  After  reading magazine articles and visiting web sites I was thoroughly confused.   All the signs of ADD described there could describe about 95% of the young  children I know.  I knew there must be more to it than that and this book  provided me with that something more.  Sears discusses a number of signs  which helped me realize the truth about my child.  Sears also provides a  very positive view of ADD.  While discussing the negatives, he gives you  ways (many, many ways) to address them and also discusses the positives,  the strengths that many children with ADD have.  He suggests many ways to  harness these strengths.  This book is such a positive read.  I am so glad  I found it.  I think any parent in my position will find it immensely  helpful.	2000-08-23

Elizabeth  Gilbert gives us a wonderful, well told story.  She starts by describing  the known history of two small islands off the coast of Maine:  Courne  Haven and Fort Niles.  She quickly focuses in on the difficult birth of a  baby girl, Ruth Thomas, in the late 1950s on Fort Niles.  A few pages  later, we meet her as an 18 year old returning home to Fort Niles after  graduating from boarding school in Delaware.  The story of Stern Men mainly  concerns itself with what Ruth does that summer--she spends time with her  idiosyncratic friends, is reuinted with her mother, who lives off the  island, and finally, falls in love.  While this is not a fast paced novel,  I still felt compelled to read it because the story is so engaging.  Ruth  and her friends were in my thoughts when I was not reading the book and I  couldn't wait to return to Stern Men.  The book is enjoyable, the story is  funny and the characters are nutty, yet still believable.  I highly  recommend this book.	2000-08-21

This is a strong collection  that certainly does not deserve these pans.  Each story in Heavy Water  contains an interesting premise that Amis runs with and makes a successful  story out of.  For instance, in Career Move, the pop culture value of poems  and screenplays have been reversed.  It's an interesting idea and a funny  story.  The last piece, What Happened to Me on my Holiday is narrated by an  11 year old who is hard to understand.  I think Amis did it this way  because he did not want the story, a heartbreaking tale of the sudden death  of a young boy, to be taken lightly, to be breezed over. This is an  interesting collection.  Give it a try if you are at all interested in  Amis' work	2000-08-19

We meet Harley, a 19 year old young  man forced by circumstances to care for his three younger sisters.  Their  lives are difficult.  His mom is in prison for murdering his child-beating  dad, Harley works two jobs, his best friend has left for college and he  really doesn't know how to raise his two younger sisters or how to handle  his wild, 16 year old sister.  It's a great story and I really enjoyed  reading it.  Harley becomes involved with the 33 year old mom of one of his  sister's playmates.  All of a sudden, though in the middle of the novel,  the plot starts taking all of these preposterous twists and turns which I  found totally unbelievable and, frankly, unnecessary.  Ms. O'Dell is a  terrific writer and could have relied on the simple story she was telling,  without going for the shock value of these plot twists.  Despite these  far-fetched twists, her writing drove me to read on and kept me up late  reading.  Ms. O'Dell clearly has a lot of talent and I will definitely read  her next work. I only hope she has the confidence to rely on her writing  and story-telling skills, and avoid those silly plot twists.	2000-08-18

This is a  terrific book about contemporary women and the crises they face after  divorce, and, as with all other Judy Blume books, she does not disappoint.

In the end, Claire's no good husband comes back  and, well I won't spoil the ending, but let's just say Claire must choose  between her husband and the hunky younger man she's met.

Their stories are quite entertaining and told with a  gentle wit.  The main characters are Smith and Ralph, two roommates who add  a third, Jem, a kooky and attractive young woman who believes that she is  destined to marry one of them.  This novel being a romantic comedy, she of  course winds up with the wrong one at first, but ultimately sees the  romantic truth (as do the other characters in the novel) at, you guessed  it, Ralph's party.  This book is a quick, non-taxing read, but I really  enjoyed it.  I kept thinking it would make a great movie, just as long as  Hugh Grant somehow gets a part.  If you are looking for a light,  entertaining novel, Ralph's party is for you.  Have fun.	2000-08-15

There were countless times as I read  the novel that someone asked me what I was reading because I was laughing  out loud.  Anna Maxted has a tremendous talent and I look forward to  reading anything else by her (hurry, please!).  Getting Over It adds an  additional, interesting layer over the typical humourous single woman in  London story in that Helen, our heroine, must deal with the sudden death of  her father and all of the complications that ensue (emotional problems,  dealing with her mother, etc.)  And yes, it is a romantic comedy, so we see  her meet a guy, lose him, etc.   All of Maxted's character's are terrific  and entertaining.  What really makes this book unique, however, is the  humor.  I highly recommend this book, but I warn you--don't read this in a  crowd if you are prone to embarrassment, you won't be able to stop yourself  from laughing out loud.	2000-08-14

What an enjoyable, hilarious and exuberantly written work this is.   Zadie Smith is a very talented writer and I only hope that she gives us  more, quickly.  The book opens with Archie Jones' failed attempt at suicide  in London in 1975.  This sounds serious, but Smith handles it with such wit  and aplomb that the scene is hilarious.  We follow Archie, his friend,  Samad Iqbal as they marry, have children and watch their children grow up  in a London they just don't understand.  The characters are hilarious.   Archie is completely clueless, but that doesn't bother him.  Samad is a  frustrated intellectual stuck being a waiter, trying desperately to  validate an act of bravery of one of his ancestors.  Their children come of  age in the cultural and ethnic melting pot that is modern London.  Smith's  characters are all wonderfully unique and terrifically funny.  I highly,  highly recommend this book.  It lives up to, and surpasses, any of the hype  you may have heard.	2000-08-13

When I first heard about  David Reimer, I couldn't understand how his parents could have agreed to do  what they did, but this book explains why in a well written book.  His  parents were told that their son would have to live &quot;a life  apart&quot; as he grew into adulthood.  I can only imagine how horrifying  that diagnosis must have been and how relieved they must have been when Dr.  John Money told them he could help.  I agree with others who say that Dr.  Money is portrayed unsympathetically in this book, but this is David's  story.  In David's eyes, Dr. Money was intent on destroying his life and  his spirit, his inner voice that kept telling him that something was not  right.<br />This work is terrific for several reasons.  Colapinto's  narrative is compelling and readable.  But this work is much more than a  readable story.  It is an inspiring story of David Reimer's inner strength  and courage which I know I will never forget.  If you have any curiousity  about David's story (and it's really hard not to) read this book.  I highly  recommend it.	2000-08-12

Beattie writes with a detached affection for her characters and a wonderful sense of clarity.   This is a collection of new stories and the greatest hits from her earlier  collection.

While there is a lot of humor in the novel, I thinkits way too dark to be funny a la Bridget Jones, which is what I was expected when I started reading.  After about 25 pages or so, when I realized that this was not another funny novel, and adjusted to the dark, and rather depressing world Claudia inhabits, I really grew to like this book.  Kate Christensen does a fabulous job of taking us into the dark world that so many women can inhabit or come close to, but she does so without depressing the reader.  I suppose that is because Claudia narrates with an amusing, self-deprecating humor. <br />I actually found this novel quite fascinating because Claudia's life reminded me of many people I knew when I was around her age (29). I think a lot of us could have drifted into the nowhere job, the drinking too much, the meaningless sex world that Claudia inhabits without actually even noticing.  I can't think of any contemporary novel that explores this idea so well, so honestly.  Claudia teetered up to the edge and almost fell over, but somehow managed to keep herself from plummeting into the depths of despair.  <br />I would strongly recommend this book with the caveat that it is not a &quot;humorous&quot; novel.  The subject matter is serious, and well-handled with much dark humor.	2000-07-27

Shannon (the narrator, as opposed to the author) is so much like many women I know that reading the novel was like chatting with a witty friend I had not seen in a while.  Her concerns and obsessions are so  real.  She's not just worried about dating and boyfriends, but about her  job, her education, her mother, her family, her life.  Everything is wryly  observed and humorous without being superficial.  Shannon sometimes probes  into truths about being a contemporary woman that most novels simply gloss  over.  Her story is funny, touching and bittersweet all at the same time.   I really enjoyed reading this novel and highly recommend it.	2000-07-24

It is a collection though, that hangs together with the unified strength of a novel.  Each story has strenghths of its own, but the effect of them as a  group is even stronger.  These are contemporary stories, each one of them  different, with different kinds of characters, but they are all about love.   Davies focuses mainly on the love between parents and children.  He  questions--Can the love between a parent and a child possibly be equal  love?  These stories will stay with you long after you read them.  They are  wonderful.  I highly recommend Equal Love.	2000-07-21

It is the story of three men, grandfather, father, son, and it is the story of their family.  We meet Norman Pelham as a young man, leaving his home in Vermont to fight in the Civil War.  He returns to Vermont with a former slave, Leah, whom he marries.  They raise a family, but Leah must return home to North Carolina to face the ghosts that haunt her there.  She comes back to Vermont soon after, so torn apart by the evil she has seen (at this point, we don't know what it is).  [I]t is only [her grandson], Foster, who is finally able to face down the demons hauning his family and to discover what happened to his family.<br />Foster's journey to North Carolina to discover the truth, the last 150 or so pages of the novel are among the most powerful, most thought provoking writing I have ever read.  I am blown away by Lent's exploration of the evil in human nature, the evil embedded in American history and how he makes it personal--intertwining it with the lives of the Pelhams.<br />That being said ... the novel could have used some editing.  Sometimes, Lent's prose is too self-conscious and stiff.  Also, as to storyline, the fact that Norman, Jamie and Foster all wind up with essentially the first woman they become involved with was a little hokey, especially for a novel of this power.  These flaws, though, are overwhelmed by the strengths of this novel.  I look forward to Lent's future work and highly recommend this novel.  It will stay with the reader long after it is finished.	2000-07-16

Brooks posits that there is anew class of cultural elite, the bourgeois bohemians, or &quot;BOBOS&quot; virtually running the US today.  Brooks  traces their development and explains various aspects of what a bobo is,  from political and religious views to work ethic and consumer patterns.   Brooks has a lot of interesting points that I think would make for an  lively discussion.  I don't think everyone will agree with all he says (too  much generalization), but that just makes the book more interesting.   Brooks thankfully never takes his subject too seriously and gently pokes  fun at the ridiculousness of these people.  If you are looking for a heavy  duty sociology tome, this is not the book.  If, however, you want something  on the lighter side, that is easy to read and that will give you a few  interesting things to say at your next cocktail party, this is the book for  you.	2000-07-11

These  stories are wonderful and are Oates at the top of her game.  Each story is  so well crafted and hauting, she gives you little slices of American life,  each one revealing a different aspect of that life.  She usually focuses on  some seamliness, something dark, something sinister, but manages to keep  the stories enjoyable to read.  I highly recommend this collection.  Oates  fans will not be disappointed and for those who are not familiar with her  work, it is the perfect introduction.	2000-07-09

This is not the sort I normally pick up and I didn't think I would like it that much, but I did.  I enjoyed it.  The Hook reaches out and grabs you right from the beginning.   The story is readable, engaging, compelling.  Of course, there are some  flaws (such as the Lady Macbeth-ness wife of one of the characters who  thinks he has this great marriage), but the novel is so entertaining that  it's easy to ignore them.  The Hook is an interesting look at the world of  publishing and novel writing.  It is the story of two writers, one  successful, one not and their deal to publish the work of one under the  name of the other.  The catch or &quot;hook&quot; is that the unsuccessful  writer must kill the wife of the successful writer.  The Hook is not great  literature, but doesn't pretend to be.  It's just an engaging story.  I  think most readers will enjoy The Hook, just as long as they are not  looking for War and Peace.	2000-07-06

Tom Drury's Grouse County and the people who inhabit it are quite a bunch.  Ther eis Dan Norman, the rather half-hearted county sheriff; his wife Louise, who  must contend with Tiny, her screw-up ex-husband and her tart-toungued  mother Mary; and an assortment of other oddball characters who pop in and  out of the narrative.  <br />This novel does not take place in the &quot;real  world&quot;, but rather in an alternative America in a parallel universe.   It's a shame that real people don't converse with the nutty, deadpan humor  that Drury's characters do.  The events in the novel happen to all of us,  but most of us don't deal with them, or comment on them, like these Grouse  County residents.  It is these differences between reality and Grouse  County that make this novel so enjoyable.  It took me about 50 pages or so  to get into the book, but once I did, I found it a completely enjoyable  read.  I would recommend this book to anyone and I look forward to reading  Drury's latest.	2000-07-05

The Poisonwood Bible, however, is quite a departure from her earlier novels in that it blew me away.  It really is  incredible.  The story is very interesting, but it is the telling that  makes this book so special.  Kingsolver tells the story through five  different narrators with five distinct voices and personalities.  Sometimes  the narration can transform what would otherwise be a dull scene into a  hilarious story.<br />The Poisonwood Bible is the story of the Price family, a  missionary, his wife and their four daughters as they travel to Africa.   The story is fascinating and its affects on each member of the family are  completely life changing.  None will be the same when the book is over and  we are the richer for having read this novel.  I highly, highly recommend  this novel.  It is perhaps the best one Oprah has picked and is far, far  superior to her normal selections.	2000-07-03

Bayley loved his wife, Iris Murdoch, so deeply, and on so many levels and that love comes across beautifully in this book.  Bayley brings us into the intimate private world  that he and Murdoch shared.  As a longtime fan of Iris Murdoch, I am  thankful for the insight into her life and her work.  This book is very  personal, so much so that I don't think it can be read in one sitting, but  rather should be savoured slowly and deliberately.  I remember the sadness  I felt hearing that she had Altzheimer's and then hearing that she died.   This book brings back that sadness, but it comes back stronger because it  also brings John Bayley's sadness.  That is not to say that this book is a  &quot;downer&quot; on any level.  Quite the contrary.  John Bayley has  constructed a beautiful book focused mainly on his love for his wife, and  how the love between them grew, from his first sighting of her riding a  bicycle to the time when he wrote this book, as she was suffering from the  ravages of the disease.	2000-06-27

I'ts not a great work of literature, but it doesn't pretend to be. It is the story of Pete, a 36 yeard old prosecutor who can't seem to let go of his misspent (and possibly more fun) youth as part of a Seattle grunge band, yet he feels the strong pull of adulthood and responsiblity. He thinks he may (gasp!) even want to get married, he just doesn't know which of his current or former girlfriends should be the one. His personal conflict becomes a professional conflict, of sorts, when he takes on a date rape case which pits his past life--the Seattle rock scene--against his future--life as a responsible member of society.<br><br>That description sounds a lot more serious than the book actually is. The characters in this book are really amusing. Pete's commitmentphobia and his fear/dread of aging, being alone, selling out will ring true to anyone in their thirties. This book reminded me a lot of Nic!k Hornby's High Fidelity (although it doesn't rise to the cult classic-ness of that book) and at times I think it was intentional (i.e., certain breakups make his top ten regrets of all time)<br><br>For a quick read, there is alot to chew on in this novel--regret, responsibility, aging, loneliness, commitment. All these serious topics, however, arise in a funny, not so serious novel that is a pleasure to read. It's the perfect book to take to the beach and then lend to all of your friends.	2000-06-27

It is the story of Warner and Megan a not so happily married couple, living on the fringes of Charlotte NC's successes with their two  young children.  The stresses on their marriage ring true and any married  person with young kids will recognize them.  The daily grind of diapers,  preschool, the depressingness of seeing others so much more successful,  driving new Volvos when your Honda is falling apart.  Leebron doesn't dwell  on any of this envy, this unhappy marriage-ness for too long, he delves in  and out of his characters heads so the reader gets a flavor of their misery  without without making the reader miserable.  Megan is then brutally  attacked and near death.  Warner is the only suspect.  Leebron then  explores what  happens to the marriage, and the family after it is torn  apart by the attack.  <br />We never really, truly know if Warner did it or  not, but that's OK.  It's not necessary because this novel is not a  mystery-thriller, it is a story of marriage and of family.  What makes this  book so enjoyable is the total believability of all of Leebron's characters  and their relationships.  We have met people like them and have felt like  them many times.  Warner is not exactly a likeable guy, but he's not awful  either, probably because the envy he feels is something we have all felt at  one time or another.<br />Six Figures is a satisfying read.  I am surprised  at, and have to disagree with, the negative reviews at this website.  Give  this book a read, I don't think you will regret it.	2000-06-25

I guess I enjoyed it, although the story was a bit hard to stomach at times.  Roberta is quite a misfit, whose first person narrative shifts between events that took place five years ago and  the present.  Lynda Barry handles the shifts flawlessly;  they all make  sense.  Five years ago, Roberta was on a cross country trip with her  murdering father, who has her pretend she's a mentally deficient boy.   Roberta recounts the horrors she witnesses with little emotion.  In the  present, 1971, Roberta is on another trip--this time on acid and various  other drugs.  She hangs out with a group of confused teenagers.  I can't  say this novel is a pleasure to read, but as I said, I did enjoy it.   Roberta's experience evokes the discomfort, the &quot;what am I doing  here&quot; sense that I think most teens have.  It's just that Roberta's  life is so far from what most teenagers have lived through.  I don't think  this book is for everyone, but if the story appeals to you, then it will be  an good read.  Barry writes quite well and the book really is a fairly  quick read.	2000-06-21

I purchased it after reading the glowing reviews at this website, but now I wonder, did we all read the same book?  The book does have a rather interesting story, rather than the  &quot;Single women can't find dates&quot; (which can be done very well,  like in Bridget Jones.  It's the story of two sisters and their attempts to  keep their inherited coffee house in Brooklyn Heights afloat.  It also has  a murder mystery aspect, but it was all just a little too contrived.  I  guess I was hoping for a humorous novel, like Bridget Jones and Tiffany  Trott, but unfortunately, this book just is not funny.  It has a light  tone--you certainly couldn't call it serious.  The characters just are not  real.  Ms. Frankel will describe her characters as being smart, intense,  etc., but just because she says they are, doesn't make it so.  The dialogue  was also very week.  People just don't talk that stiffly.  The book is also  billed into a study of the relationship between sisters, but it's too  shallow to accomplish anything.<br />I suppose though, it is a nice quick  read, and if you have a three hour plane flight and don't want anything  taxing, this novel might be appropriate.	2000-06-18

Elizabeth Strout manages to take a simple, almost mundane story about a mother and her teenage daughter amd make it something special.  The story takes place in a year in the life of  Isabelle, a single mother, and her daughter Amy.  Amy falls in love with  her math teacher, and mother and daughter are, at least for a while, torn  apart.<br />What makes this novel so special is the incredible evocative  powers Strout has.  She is able to, with very few words, bring you to a  time and a place, and you are there.  That is not to say that the writing  is in anyway &quot;spare&quot;.  Quite the contrary, this is a rich novel,  but without any excess weight.  Amy and Isabelle, as characters are  completely real, completely believable.<br />Although I do give this novel 5  stars, it does have a few, minor flaws.  Amy never wonders about her  father, which I found a little hard to accept.  Additionally, sometimes,  Strout's involvement of the minor characters seemed a little forced.  As a  whole, however, this is an outstanding first novel and I look forward to  her future works.  I also think this would make a great book club book as  in it there are many topics for discussion--mother/daughter relationships,  parenting, youth, to name a few.	2000-06-16

It's the perfect antidote to those unrealistic Disney stories (i.e., Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty).  And don't get me wrong, I think that those Disney stories can be fabulous, but the subliminal messages are somewhat 18th  century.  The Paper Bag Princess, on the other hand is decidely modern.   Its message is: if a guy isn't nice to you, he's not worth it, leave him.   Really, is there a more important message about relationships that we ought  to be sending to our daughters?  There are other wonderful messages in here  for girls:  you are resourceful, be strong.  And, as an added benefit, this  is a great and funny book, both of my daughters love it.  This would make a  great gift to all of the  young girls in your life (and I think the age  range should start at 2, not 4).	2000-06-14

More Bread or I'll Appear is the story of an Irish family and their quest for a missing  sibling.  Each family has his or her own demons to deal with.  Molly, the  mother is stuck in Ireland, too scared to venture out and look for her  precious first-born, Aisling; Oscar, her twin brother, is a homosexual,  alcoholic priest, living in terror that his secrets will be revealed;  Siobhan is anorexic, Orla has never gotten over the  baby she gave up for  adoption, Patrick has no ambition and drug addict friends.  Keelin, the  youngest, is perhaps the only sibling with some semblance of a  &quot;normal&quot; life.  It is she that Molly convinces to embark on a  devastating journey to locate her lost sister, who disappeared 15 years  earlier, almost without a trace.  Keelin, accompanied by various siblings  at various points in the narrative, learns some disturbing truths about her  sister, and the rest of her family, as she searches.  <br />Martin writes with  a sarcastic, twisted humor that keeps this novel from plunging into the  depressing underbelly of humanity that Keelin discovers in her search for  her sister.  Keelin comes to understand that the one thing that ties her  family together is also tearing it apart--the obsessive compusive disorder  that sent her father to an asylum.  <br />More Bread or I'll Appear is a  disturbing novel, a unique novel, a funny novel.  I don't think it is for  the faint of heart.  I enjoyed this novel, and would encourage any daring  reader to discover the world of Keelin and her family.	2000-06-11

It's an amazing story told by a man with an equally amazing story.  I only hope we don't have to wait  another 12 years for Nolan's next novel.  The Banyon Tree pulls you in  immediately and keeps you reading until the last page with prose that will  take your breath away.  Nolan's characters, especially Minnie, the  80-something protagonist are so real.  They are normal people but Nolan  tells his tale in such a way that they become extraordinary.  Minnie has  three children, and waits patiently for 40 years for the youngest, the one  who left one day at age 18 to return to the family's Irish farm.  She keeps  the farm for him, living simply, thinking every day he will come back.   She, and we, don't know his fate until almost the end of the book.  This is  a story of family, of love, of truth, of denial.  There is something  magical in Nolan's storytelling, something that hints at the stories untold  that circle around the story we are reading.  I highly,  highly recommend  this book.  It's a treasure.	2000-06-07

She has boldly gone where other parenting advice books dare not go--she tells the truth about parenting toddlers with a humorous approach.  I think this book is a must have for the first time  parent once their little darling reaches about his or her first birthday.   The one thing you'll take away from this book is that there is no right or  wrong way to approach a toddler issue (potty training, moving to the big  bed), an approach I think all parents need to embrace.  Ms. Iovine is not a  pediatrician, a psychologist, or an professional &quot;expert&quot; of any  kind, and she frequently reminds us of that.  What she is is a mom of 4  kids (who have all survived toddlerhood), with lots of chatty friends.  You  will come away from this book feeling as if you have just been at a really  useful girls' night out.  I think the chapter on potty training alone makes  the book worth getting.  In certain instances, such as potty training, I  believe that advice from the trenches, as this book is, is the most useful.   This book is enjoyable to read, and quite funny in places, but I also  think that I will reread certain chapters when undergoing one crisis or  another as my toddler grows.  Ms. Iovine also includes a really sweet top  ten list of &quot;Why we love toddlers&quot; which with bring tears to moms  everywhere.	2000-06-05

Are you a patient reader?  If the answer is yes to both questions, then this  book is for you.  The book, which involves a federal investigation into a  corrupt judiciary scheme takes place in Turow's fictional Kindle County.   We meet Robbie Feaver as he is coerced into cooperating with the  investigation.  The book takes off slowly and at the beginning, I confess I  really did not like the book all that much.  It was a little dry and  sometimes had the look and feel of a legal memo (which are not that  exciting, and if you've never read one, trust me on this).  There was  something that kept me reading and I am glad I did.  I think it may have  simply been the fact that the characters and what they do are truly  realistic.  As the book continues, Turow throws in some interesting, and  yet still believable plot twists. His characters, at least the main ones  are fairly multidimensional and the world they live in not all black and  white, good and evil, but shades of grey.  Robbie is not the most likable  character, but is ultimately sympathetic.  His choices, like those of the  other characters, were not always good ones, but he is human.  All in all  this is an enjoyable novel if you have the patience to stick throught the  first 100 pages or so.	2000-05-28

Helen Fielding has done it again.  She has crafted an entertaining and truly funny novel that is sure to entertain all but the most grumpy of  readers.  Where as most comic novels I read make me think their jokes are  very clever, Fieldings jokes make me think they are clever and I am amazed  at how creative she can be.  This sort of  humor is probably very difficult  to sustain, but Fielding is a master.  Bridget is a slightly silly person,  a bit on the unrealistic side, but I suppose diaries (as this is) may  include ones ultimate unrealistic fantasies (like being rescued by Colin  Firth or Prince William).  While Bridget is on the edge of reason, her  on-again off-again boyfriend is the voice of reason and the perfect comic  foil.  Her friends are as wacky as she is and their antics are sure to  amuse as are Bridget's comments about everyone and everything around her.   Bridget Jones:  The Edge of Reason is solid entertainment and certainly  worth reading.  I seriously could not put it down after the first 50 pages.   Enjoy.	2000-05-18

I only wish that I had had this  book 4 years ago when my first child was born.  The book has lots of  wonderful information that frankly I have not found anywhere else.  It  tells you how much of each nutrient your child will need at various ages  and suggests some child friendly sources for those nutrients.  What the  book does not have is an instantaneous solution for getting a vegetable  hater to eat vegetables.  Their answer to this problem is to keep offering  it and eventually they will eat their vegetables (or whatever else it is  you want them to eat).  I have been trying this forever with my daughter  and it only works with non-green vegetables.  They do provide some  excellent advice on preventing picky eaters (which I have followed with my  second and which works).  One way I judge books such as these is to decide  if the book could have been condensed into a useful magazine article, or if  the content really needed to be put into a book.  The information in  Feeding Your Child for Lifelong Health definitely belongs in a book.  There  are not many wasted pages or irrelevant information.  I highly recommend  this book to all parents of young children, with the caveats discussed  above.	2000-05-15
2482113:US	52947077	RS75TA9S12JZU	0679723420	755867934	Pale Fire	Books	5	32	40	N	N	A Brilliant Rollick	Pale Fire is a wonderfully enjoyable work of fiction, although it is not in the form of a traditional novel.  The story unfolds in an introduction to, and commentary to a 999 line poem.  It appears that Nabakov had great  fun constructing this masterpiece and I think the reader will have fun  deciphering it.  The introduction and commentary are &quot;written&quot; by  a slightly insane, slightly delusional professor, Charles Kinbote, who is  perhaps a deposed king on the run, perhaps not.  He believes he has  inspired the poet to construct a poem about his former kingdom, but alas,  the poem is about the poet's life.  Kinbote is greatly disappointed, but in  his commentary manages to find allusions to his former kingdom and rambles  on and on about it.  The results are often hilarious and always thought  provoking.  Nabokov has such a good time writing in English and because it  is not his native toungue, he sees things in the words that native English  speakers wouldn't.  It's fun to watch him play with the words, as it's fun  to watch him play with our conceptions of reality.  The whole book plays  around with what is reality, who is the narrator.  Is it Nabokov pretending  to be Kinbote, is it just Nabokov.  One wonders what really happened in the  story.  Kinbote tells one version, the characters he speaks of tells  another, as does our poet, John Shade, Nabokov is telling yet another.   There are so many layers of story and illusion.  I found myself wondering  what really happened, but it's fiction, nothing happened, or everything  happened.  I really enjoyed this book a great deal.  It even took my mind  off of being in the dentist's chair.  I highly recommend this book to  anyone who isn't afraid of slightly experimental fiction.  Fans of Infinite  Jest and House of Leaves will certainly enjoy Pale Fire.	2000-05-12
2490679:US	52947077	R37R25DRUHP1ZM	0553213415	73897934	Madame Bovary (Bantam Classics)	Books	5	6	10	N	Y	A Fabulous Classic with Modern Appeal	I think this is a wonderful novel.  Although it carries around the &quot;classic&quot; label, I think Madame Bovary is an enjoyable, accessible, reader-friendly read.  The story is actually quite simple.  A  French woman marries too rashly, for the wrong reasons, is unhappy,  conducts two affairs, and eventually gets into tremendous debt and commits  suicide.  With that plot, Flaubert manages to create a masterpiece that  subtly ridicules all types of human folly, not just Emma's overwhelming  romanticism.  Science, religion, realism as embodied by various characters  all come off unsympathetically, yet the book is still a joy to read, which  I believe is Flaubert's brilliance.  The only drawback to the novel is that  it is in translation (at least it is for me).  There are some passages that  are stunning, yet I know in French they would be even more so.  That being  said, I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in literature.	2000-05-08

It's not great literature, but we can't read Tolstoy all the time, can we?  I think any woman over thirty, regardless of her relationship status, will see shades of herself in Tiffany, if only the tendency to overpack or to be gullible to any  overpriced skin treatment.  I must admit, I found Tiffany a bit annoying  for the first 50 pages or so, but she grew on me.  Isabel Wolff has crafted  an thoroughly engaging story.  This one will keep you reading.  I found  myself slipping away for any brief moment to see how Tiffany's next date  went.  Some may complain that the foreshadowing is a bit obvious (it is,  but who cares, this book is really funny).  Others may complain that the  characters are a bit one dimensional (they are, but see previous  parenthetical).  I would recommend this book to anyone with a sense of  humor.  Just keep it on your bookshelf for the next time you need a good  laugh, are going on a long trip, or come down with a cold and need to put  down War and Peace for a while.  You won't regret it.  A note to Bridget  Jones fans (of which I am one) - this book is similar to Bridget Jones,  there is no denying it, but Bridget and Tiffany are different people  ultimately and these are different books.	2000-04-25
2518453:US	52947077	R12X8XAR7ZKZPO	0375703764	383727435	House of Leaves	Books	4	0	2	N	Y	An enjoyable read by a daring newcomer	This book is really a lot of fun, but it is certainly not for someone who expects something like Stephen King.  I bought this book and started reading it before I heard all of the &quot;hype&quot;.  It took me about  three pages and all I could think of was Infinite Jest (and not Stephen  King).  The book pokes fun at academia and its tendency to overanalyze ad  nauseum.  He's got two interesting stories intertwined, but frankly it took  me a while to get into the story of the house, while Johnny Truant's story  I found interesting from the get go.  I would recommend this book to  someone who enjoys David Foster Wallace and who is not afraid to read  footnotes.  I completely disagree with some of the reviewers here who  recommend skipping the footnotes.  Frankly, they don't get it, and you  won't either if you skip them.  If you like Stephen King and want a scary  novel, wait for his next book.	2000-04-23

The stories of the four women were interesting in the way that All My Children is.  But all of these women  were going through terrible experiences, all at the same time, which I  found unbelievable and a little tiring after a while.  Also the novel is  supposed to be told by four different women, but the narrative seemed to be  told by the same person in four different moods, which made it difficult to  follow at first.  The ending also was way, way too pat.  All of a sudden,  their problems are over.  Just a little too simplistic.  All that said, I  did enjoy it and stayed up until almost midnight last night reading it.   It's not quite a guilty pleasure, but it verges on it.  I wouldn't  recommend it if you are looking for something substantial, just a light  read, perfect for a long plane ride or a weekend away.	1999-10-11

I think because it was so real.  At first, all of the characters seemed to be, well, just losers, but as you get to know them they all had some sort of redeeming quality.  (At least most of them did).  It was an enjoyable, rambling read.  I must agree with the other readers that she did have too many characters.  We wouldn't hear from someone in a while and then all of a sudden, they would appear.  It was a little disconcerting at times.  Even though I have these complaints about the book, I still keep thinking about it, about the characters.  I wish I could figure out why.  It's not like her prose style is amazing, or groudbreaking, like Joyce Carol Oates, and it's not like her characters were charmingly entertaining with humorous quirks, like John Irving.  I guess it's because these people were like people you know and encounter every day of your life.  They have faults and they are not perfect.  We see that Marie has been frustrated by h	1997-09-05
